### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度传感的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场窄、复杂场景中结构失真等固有局限性，需要与RGB图像融合来提升深度感知质量。

Method: 首先通过精确几何校准将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进方法，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘锐度和无缝视场扩展。

Conclusion: 该iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，有效解决了iToF深度传感的局限性，为高质量的深度感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [2] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练后框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，通过图像生成和多模态代理评估的交替过程，使用语言引导的规划器和评论器评估对象计数、空间排列和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确性，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，得分0.97优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代结构化反馈有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合推理和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在困难，限制了处理新对象属性组合的能力。本研究旨在探索这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器，发现MLP层中单个神经元代表多个特征的现象（特征叠加）。

Result: 证明特征叠加现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，从而影响了组合推理和对象绑定性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为揭示视觉语言模型中组合失败机制根源迈出了第一步，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的创新框架，通过整合记忆、空间和决策三个模块，解决了传统LLM方法在空间推理、跨模态对齐和长时记忆方面的缺陷，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一大型语言模型的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态对齐差、长时任务内存过载等关键缺陷，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个协同模块：1) 记忆模块 - 动态地图记忆，通过选择性节点剪枝处理内存过载；2) 空间模块 - 空间推理和物体关系推断，基于新构建的I-O-S数据集微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Sp；3) 决策模块 - 基于LLM的路径规划执行稳健动作。

Result: 在I-O-S测试集上，Qwen-Sp在物体列表提取方面优于领先的商业LLM，获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。在R2R和REVERIE数据集上的广泛实验显示MSNav达到了最先进的性能，在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MSNav通过模块化架构将脆弱的推理转变为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了VLN任务中的关键挑战，为视觉语言导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Result: 提出的方法获得了高效的分类结果，两种群体智能算法在土壤类型多分类过程中都表现出良好性能

Conclusion: 结合卷积神经网络和群体智能优化算法能够有效提升土壤图像分类的准确性和性能，为土壤分类提供了有价值的解决方案

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QA-VLM框架，利用视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，结合领域专业知识，为增材制造提供可解释的质量评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的增材制造质量评估依赖人工专家，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在实际应用中的可信度和采用率

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并从同行评审期刊文章中提取应用特定知识来生成可解释的质量评估

Result: 在24个激光线材直接能量沉积样品上评估，相比现成视觉语言模型，该框架在解释质量方面表现出更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在增材制造应用中实现可信赖、可解释的质量评估

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了The Loupe，一种轻量级即插即用的注意力模块，可插入预训练Transformer中，通过复合损失函数引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，显著提升细粒度视觉分类性能并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中需要高精度，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，难以获得信任和验证。

Method: 开发The Loupe模块，可插入Swin Transformer等预训练骨干网络，使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，无需部件级标注即可引导模型关注判别性特征。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，Swin-Base模型准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，增益2.66%，注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为模型决策过程的理解和信任提供有价值工具。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID19患者CT扫描图像，预测病情严重程度，帮助医生做出临床决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID19大流行造成全球治疗资源紧张，病人因呼吸力衰竭而死亡。人工分析CT扫描容易出错，需要更准确的自动化方法来预测病情严重程度

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者CT肺部扫描图像进行分析。模型在病人检测阻性后一个月内预测病情严重程度

Result: 机器学习模型能够提供更高准确性的预测，减少人为错误，通过持续训练进一步提升性能

Conclusion: 这种人工智能方法有力支持医疗决策，在全球健康危机中帮助优先分配有限的医疗资源，救测更多生命

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

### [9] [MedRepBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Medical Report Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16674)
*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedRepBench是一个用于评估医学报告结构化理解能力的综合基准，包含1900份中文医学报告，支持客观和主观评估协议，并通过GRPO优化提升了VLM模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基准来评估医学报告的结构化解释质量，需要建立全面的评估体系来推动医学文档理解技术的发展。

Method: 构建包含1900份真实中文医学报告的基准数据集，设计客观评估（字段级召回率）和主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理）两种协议，并应用GRPO优化VLM模型。

Result: 通过GRPO优化使中等规模VLM获得高达6%的召回率提升，发现OCR+LLM管道存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医学报告理解提供了标准化评估基准，证明了完全基于视觉的报告理解方法的必要性，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

### [10] [Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739)
*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级两阶段框架，用于无人机实时野火监测和火源检测，通过策略网络压缩冗余视频帧并改进YOLOv8模型，显著降低计算成本同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络识别和丢弃冗余视频片段，采用帧压缩技术和站点机制；第二阶段对分类为"火灾"的帧使用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 在FLAME和HMDB51数据集上评估第一阶段，在Fire & Smoke数据集上评估第二阶段。实验结果显示显著降低计算成本同时保持分类准确性，检测精度更高且推理时间相近。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，在计算效率和检测精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个新颖的空间感知深度学习框架，通过自然语言类比分析全切片图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域视为短语、组织结构视为句子，自动学习上下文依赖的含义来预测肺腺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管手术切除，约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在五年内复发，现有工具无法识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将全切片图像建模为自然语言：细胞作为单词，细胞邻域作为短语，组织结构作为句子，自动学习上下文依赖的含义和空间相互作用来预测复发风险。

Result: 在456个H&E染色全切片图像数据集上，CellEcoNet实现了优异的预测性能（AUC:77.8%，HR:9.54），优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和最先进的计算方法，并在不同人口统计学和临床亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了预后预测，还通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细微细胞变异如何编码复发风险，代表了范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿来评估文本到图像生成模型公平性和实用性的方法，通过超参数优化来平衡这两个指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，无法同时评估公平性和实用性

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿分析不同去偏方法的超参数配置，以Normalized Shannon Entropy评估公平性，ClipScore评估实用性

Result: 研究发现大多数文本到图像模型的默认超参数配置在公平性-实用性空间中都是被支配解，很容易找到更好的超参数配置

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统性地比较不同文本到图像模型，识别出在给定实用性下优化公平性的最佳配置，反之亦然

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和原型到代码生成三个核心Web任务，揭示当前多模态大语言模型在推理、定位和功能保持方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，缺乏对模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解编码能力的综合评估。

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据统一评估三个核心任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理定位、保持功能性的代码编辑、支持多语言内容的层次结构保持方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs存在重要局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理。

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别真实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理未知类别和属性的开放词汇检测系统。

Method: 使用基础模型连接3D特征与文本语义，联合检测空间关系、运动状态等属性；采用基础模型特征拼接、提示调优策略、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等技术。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，在未给定新类别锚点尺寸的条件下，OVODA在开放词汇3D物体检测方面优于现有最先进方法，并成功识别物体属性。

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了包含全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络方法在天文图像处理中存在局限，需要开发更适合像素级比较的架构，同时避免计算昂贵的差异成像过程

Method: 采用Transformer架构的神经网络，直接分析搜索图像和模板图像，进行像素级比较，无需生成差异图像

Result: 在DES autoScan数据集上达到97.4%的分类准确率，训练集增大时差异图像的性能效用递减，即使输入图像未对准超新星候选体也能保持相似性能水平

Conclusion: 该网络显著提高了大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，展示了Transformer架构在天文图像分类任务中的优势

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA使用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样和显著加速推理，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为动作解码器需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在实际高频控制场景中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调

Result: NinA在相同训练机制下与扩散模型性能相当，但推理速度显著更快

Conclusion: NinA为高效高频VLA控制提供了有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道状态信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：第一阶段使用平面高斯几何基元进行密集表面对齐场景重建；第二阶段结合结构化无线电辐射场和定制多视图损失精确建模无线电传播行为。

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，能够高效表示无线信道。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，通过创新的几何表示和无线电传播建模方法解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

TL;DR: GPO是一种新颖的可变形视网膜图像配准框架，通过高斯基元优化和结构化消息传递，解决了传统方法在纹理稀疏区域梯度信号弱的问题，显著提升了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临重大挑战，因为大面积的均匀区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架中的梯度信号有限，难以实现精确的变形配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1) 初始粗配准后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2) 每个节点建模为具有可训练位置、位移和半径的高斯基元；3) 使用KNN高斯插值传播位移信号；4) 通过多损失项进行端到端优化，确保关键点一致性和强度对齐。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，GPO将目标配准误差从6.2像素降低到约2.4像素，并将25像素处的AUC从0.770提升到0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域战略性地锚定节点并采用结构化消息传递机制，有效解决了视网膜图像配准中的梯度消失问题，为医学图像分析提供了更精确的配准解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Conclusion: 该研究弥补了多模态情感推理领域的研究空白，通过多代理框架和维度丰富的测试集，为提升人机交互的情感理解能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

TL;DR: Delta-SVD是一种无需训练的后处理压缩方法，通过奇异值分解(SVD)压缩DreamBooth微调产生的权重增量，实现高效存储个性化扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化文本到图像模型需要微调大规模扩散主干网络，当维护多个特定主题模型时会产生巨大的存储开销。

Method: 利用权重增量具有强低秩结构的特点，首先应用奇异值分解分解权重增量，然后采用基于能量的秩截断策略来平衡压缩效率和重建保真度。

Result: 在多主题数据集上的实验表明，Delta-SVD实现了显著的压缩，在CLIP分数、SSIM和FID等生成质量指标上损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，为需要存储和部署大规模主题定制化的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 理解视觉内容如何传达情感在社交媒体时代至关重要，但由于情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，这仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，采用三种方法：(1)使用MLLM直接进行图像情感分类；(2)将MLLM与预训练LLM关联，分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注的图像描述上微调LLM。

Result: 在基准测试中，特别是微调方法，比基于词典、CNN和Transformer的基线方法分别高出30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。在跨数据集测试中，未经新数据训练仍比最佳竞争对手高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了所提出的视觉推理方案在推进情感计算方面的潜力，同时为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在恶劣天气下的多模态图像融合中缺乏对文本信息的有效分类和深入分析，无法充分解决天气退化导致的视觉信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出全局特征感知模块使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型，局部模块利用ChatGPT生成的详细场景描述关注具体退化效果，通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 大量实验表明AWM-Fuse在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本引导的全局和局部感知有效提升了恶劣天气下的图像融合质量，实现了更好的语义对齐和特征学习。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Motivation: Vision Transformer在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但存在模型大、计算成本高和局部特征建模能力弱的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出SAEViT模型，包含稀疏聚合注意力模块(SAA)进行自适应稀疏采样，通道交互前馈网络(CIFFN)增强通道间信息交换，以及嵌入深度可分离卷积块(DWSConv)的分层金字塔结构。

Conclusion: SAEViT提供了一个轻量级的解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于各种基础视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法主要关注整体分数拟合，忽略了人类从多个维度评估图像质量的事实，需要更符合人类感知的多维度评估框架。

Method: 构建包含5个技术维度和4个美学维度的多分支网络，每个分支单独训练特定维度特征，最后融合生成最终质量分数，并可灵活调整维度权重用于图像修复。

Conclusion: 多维图像质量评估框架能更好地模拟人类视觉感知，提供更灵活和个性化的图像质量评估和修复方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Conclusion: SEGS是一个有效的训练无关解决方案，能够无缝集成到现有SDS/VSD流程中，解决文本到3D生成的视角一致性问题

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

### [28] [MSPCaps: A Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network with Cross-Agreement Routing for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16922)
*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽略多尺度信息和特征融合困难的问题，在分类准确率和模型效率方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，而传统的特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一分块为初级胶囊；跨协议路由(CAR)块通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，模型配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)都表现优异。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，在特征表示学习方面具有重要推进潜力，为解决多尺度特征融合问题提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一个基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，使用电影CMR序列进行无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与延迟钆增强序列的潜在空间对齐，在消除钆依赖性的同时实现了94.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)虽然是心肌病诊断的金标准，但对钆对比剂的依赖和劳动密集型的解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的准确筛查方法。

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，将电影CMR和延迟钆增强序列的潜在空间对齐，编码纤维化特异性病理信息；采用特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，并通过不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标。

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上评估，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅使用电影CMR的模型性能提升4.3%，同时消除了对钆的依赖。

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模人群筛查提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个创新的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现无需重新训练的自然语言驱动的3D内容编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程，而视觉语言模型虽然能够直接进行2D图像个性化，但由于3D内容与2D图像的结构差异，无法直接应用于3D个性化

Method: 开发相机条件的3D到文本逆向机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中，建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化，无需计算密集的重新训练过程

Conclusion: Invert3D通过创新的对齐机制，成功解决了3D内容个性化中的效率挑战，为自然语言驱动的3D内容编辑提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our
work is available at: https://github.com/qsong2001/Invert3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的嵌入层级别攻击，显著提高了对抗性扰动的可迁移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对抗性扰动生成方法通常在源模型的单个中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像的嵌入分离，但这种方法往往过度关注少数代表相似概念的神经元，而忽略了层内其他神经元。

Method: NAT（Neuron Attack for Transferability）将焦点从嵌入层分离转向更基础的神经元特定方法，通过针对个体神经元来破坏神经网络的核心单元，为不同模型间的可迁移性提供共同基础。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上的广泛实验表明，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅需10次查询就能实现令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 神经元级别的攻击方法比传统的层级别优化更有效，能够更好地破坏神经网络的核心功能单元，从而显著提高对抗性扰动的可迁移性和攻击效率。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用。需要能够提供结构化详细反馈的动作评估系统。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 逐步动作推理 - 专门设计的思维链过程，从整体识别到子动作分析再到最终评分；2) 分层策略学习 - 强化学习策略，学习细粒度子动作动态并与高层动作质量对齐

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该模型能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合逐步推理和分层学习，成功实现了既准确又具有解释性的人类动作评估，为解决现有方法的局限性提供了有效方案

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 传统基于扩散的去雾方法在处理密集非均匀雾霾时存在生成条件不足和空间适应性差的问题，导致恢复效果不佳。

Method: 提出RPD-Diff模型，包含物理引导中间状态目标策略(PIST)利用物理先验重构扩散马尔可夫链，以及雾感知去噪时间步预测器(HADTP)通过透射图交叉注意力机制动态调整补丁特定去噪时间步。

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D仿真在复杂环境（如密集温室）中表现不佳，而现有的神经渲染方法虽然视觉逼真但缺乏集成基准标记的能力，而基准标记对于机器人定位和控制至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种混合框架，将高斯泼溅(GS)的光照真实感与结构化标记表示相结合，提出了一种新颖算法来在杂乱场景中高效生成基于GS的基准标记（如AprilTags）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在效率和姿态估计精度方面均优于传统的图像拟合技术，并在温室仿真中展示了框架的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架在具有密集 foliage、相似元素和遮挡的农业环境中表现出色，突显了其在现实世界应用中的价值，特别是在机器人感知面临极限挑战的场景中。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的拥挤人群计数模型LIMM，强调局部建模能力，通过窗口划分和对比学习策略显著提升了高密度区域的计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考拥挤人群计数的本质特征：个体（人头）在图像中通常占据很小比例，现有方法过度追求大感受野而忽视了局部建模能力的重要性。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用两种策略：1）网格窗口划分设计处理模型输入；2）窗口级对比学习增强局部密度区分能力；末端加入全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如JHU-Crowd++高密度子集MAE提升8.7%），同时保持对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是拥挤人群计数的关键设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口设计和对比学习策略有效解决了高密度区域的计数挑战。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和多模态模型在科学工程应用中处理视觉信息时，对常见的视觉扰动（如噪声、模糊、遮挡）缺乏鲁棒性，而现有的评估基准大多忽视了这一挑战，导致模型在真实世界科学文档中的稳健推理能力未被充分探索。

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4V等最先进的闭源多模态大语言模型，在面对扰动输入时也表现出显著的性能下降（清洁准确率85.2% vs PRS 72.1%）。

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的鲁棒性，新提出的评估指标和数据集为未来研究提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在真实世界应用中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Motivation: 现有的场景流估计方法主要关注两帧输入，忽略了时序信息；而多帧方法随着帧数增加计算成本急剧上升。需要一种既能有效利用时序信息又计算高效的方法。

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架：1) 使用Δ方案以最小计算成本提取时序特征；2) 引入类别平衡损失处理类别不平衡问题；3) 使用实例一致性损失确保物体运动一致性。

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和针对性的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-VAR是一个新颖的车辆增强现实框架，通过语义分解、上下文感知SLAM分支和LLM驱动的推荐系统，在驾驶场景中实现动态AR叠加效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR系统通常假设静态或单视图设置，无法有效处理驾驶场景中动态变化的驾驶舱和道路环境。需要一种能够动态分离不同场景并提供上下文感知AR推荐的系统。

Method: 使用深度引导的视觉-语言基础技术动态分离驾驶舱和道路场景；采用两个SLAM分支分别跟踪不同上下文的自我运动；基于GPT的模块生成上下文感知的AR叠加内容（如仪表盘提示和危险警报）；构建了EgoSLAM-Drive真实世界数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验表明SEER-VAR在不同环境中实现了稳健的空间对齐和感知一致的AR渲染；通过结构化提示和详细用户研究，系统显著提升了场景理解、叠加相关性和驾驶员易用性。

Conclusion: SEER-VAR为基于LLM的自我中心驾驶AR推荐系统提供了有效基础，是这一研究方向的首批探索之一，代码和数据集将开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

TL;DR: HCG-LVLM是一个新颖的分层上下文接地视觉语言大模型，采用从粗到细的认知处理方式，通过全局上下文感知层和细粒度局部接地层的双层架构，显著提升了精细视觉语言理解和准确定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言大模型在复杂真实场景中表现出鲁棒性不足、容易产生幻觉和推理错误的问题，特别是在需要精确图像区域定位和细粒度视觉推理的任务中。

Method: 提出HCG-LVLM架构，包含全局上下文感知层进行初步广泛理解，以及细粒度局部接地层（包含局部细节增强模块和高分辨率特征提取，以及语义一致性验证器确保准确的视觉语言对齐），通过自适应融合机制整合两层信息。

Conclusion: 分层设计在增强细粒度视觉语言理解和精确接地能力方面具有有效性，验证了从粗到细认知处理方式的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于旋转分支定界搜索的几何最大重叠配准框架，通过分解刚体变换和范围最大查询优化，在多项式时间复杂度和线性空间复杂度下实现高精度点云配准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于空间兼容性图的方法需要二次空间和时间复杂度，而多阶段分支定界搜索方法容易陷入局部最优。需要一种更高效准确的点云配准方法

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿旋转轴的平移和2D刚体变换。通过分支定界搜索最优旋转轴和角度，将剩余参数建模为范围最大查询问题。采用立方体映射参数化半球搜索候选旋转轴，通过区间穿刺估计平移，使用扫描线算法和线段树解决2D几何重叠问题

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的几何分解和高效算法设计，解决了高离群率点云配准中的计算复杂度和精度问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出Joint Parameter Selection (JPS)方法，通过选择性地微调预训练模型中一小部分参数，在保持模型泛化能力的同时实现领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练模型固有泛化能力的问题，需要在任务适应和泛化保持之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用双重操作符选择在所有源域中表现出一致且显著梯度的参数子集进行稀疏更新，理论推导了参数更新稀疏性的泛化误差界。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，JPS方法相比最先进的领域泛化方法取得了更优的性能。

Conclusion: JPS方法通过选择性参数更新有效平衡了任务适应和泛化保持，证明了参数高效适应策略在领域泛化中的有效性。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理计算成本过高，现有特征缓存方法因无法准确建模特征演化复杂动态而导致质量下降

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且质量超过基线，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均表现优异

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐的数学工具有效解决了扩散模型加速中的质量损失问题，为高效推理提供了新思路

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: EDLDNet在多样化数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力、计算效率和鲁棒性，成功解决了医学图像分割中精度与效率的平衡问题

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验表明，CPC超越了现有的最先进弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: CPC通过利用LLM生成的类别聚类和对比学习机制，有效解决了现有方法在相关类别混淆和细粒度区分方面的局限性，为弱监督语义分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在手写文本生成中容易记忆训练样本，对风格变化敏感，且在高引导尺度下会产生噪声和伪影，影响生成文本的可读性。

Method: 提出DOG策略：利用负向扰动提示的正交投影到原始正向提示，在潜在空间中提供更稳定、解耦的引导方向；采用三角调度控制去噪过程中的引导强度。

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验表明，DOG显著提升了内容清晰度和风格多样性，特别是在生僻词和挑战性书写风格上表现优异。

Conclusion: DOG提供了一种有效的采样引导方法，能够改善扩散模型在手写文本生成中的性能，减少伪影同时保持内容准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和注意力机制有效解决了在线动作检测中的视角泛化问题，在多视角场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的局部聚焦机制(LFM)用于深度伪造检测，通过显著性网络和Top-K池化模块来关注最具信息量的局部特征，解决了现有方法在跨类别和跨生成域泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重建学习的深度伪造检测方法存在两个主要问题：1) 在特定类别上训练的模型容易过拟合语义特征分布，难以迁移到其他类别；2) 全局平均池化会压缩并丢弃关键的局部伪造线索，影响真假分类的判别能力。

Method: 提出了局部聚焦机制(LFM)，包含显著性网络(SNet)和任务特定的Top-K池化(TKP)模块来选择K个最具信息量的局部模式。为了防止Top-K池化可能带来的过拟合，引入了两种正则化技术：基于排名的线性丢弃(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)。

Result: LFM在准确率上比最先进的邻域像素关系(NPR)方法提高了3.7%，平均精度提高了2.8%，同时在单个NVIDIA A6000 GPU上保持了1789 FPS的卓越效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨域深度伪造检测设立了新的基准，通过关注局部判别特征显著提升了检测性能的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点-体素交互机制，有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏问题，为3D场景理解提供了高质量的点云数据。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Conclusion: REGEN框架成功实现了游戏帧率下的实时照相实感增强，为实时渲染领域提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在挑战，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2）通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干，采用双分支注意力机制

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上优于现有模型

Conclusion: SSG-DiT通过空间信号引导和高效适配器设计，有效解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频生成提供了新思路

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

### [59] [Proximal Vision Transformer: Enhancing Feature Representation through Two-Stage Manifold Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17081)
*Haoyu Yun,Hamid Krim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Vision Transformer与近端工具相结合的新框架，通过几何优化方法增强特征表示和分类性能，解决了ViT在全局几何关系建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ViT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其优化仅限于建模单个图像内的局部关系，无法捕捉数据点之间的全局几何关系，这限制了其性能。

Method: 将ViT与近端工具集成，ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切丛（每个注意力头对应一个切空间），然后引入近端迭代来定义切丛中的截面并将数据从切空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面优于传统ViT。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何优化方法有效增强了ViT的特征表示能力，在保持局部关系建模优势的同时，成功捕捉了全局几何关系，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

TL;DR: PD-Loss是一种新的深度度量学习方法，结合了可学习代理和统计可分性指标d'，在保持计算效率的同时优化嵌入空间的全局分布特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度度量学习方法存在局限性：成对损失需要复杂采样且收敛慢；基于代理的方法可扩展性好但无法优化全局分布；D-Loss关注分布可分性但对计算资源要求高。

Method: 提出Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss)，通过代理估计真实和冒名分布，将可学习代理与统计可分性指标d'相结合，实现高效的嵌入空间优化。

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务上的实验表明，PD-Loss达到了最先进方法的性能水平，同时提供了可扩展的分布感知优化能力。

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功结合了代理方法的计算效率和D-Loss的原则性可分性，为嵌入优化提供了新的视角，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

TL;DR: GRASP是一个基于强化学习的结构化策略学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成边界框和关键点，再由预训练分割模型生成最终掩码，无需密集像素监督即可实现地理空间像素推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM系统需要密集像素监督进行联合训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳。需要一种能够利用基础模型强先验、最小化可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习的方法。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型从视觉-语言指令中生成任务相关的边界框和正点，然后将这些输出传递给预训练分割模型作为提示来生成最终掩码。完全使用强化学习（GRPO）进行优化，仅使用格式奖励和准确性奖励。

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法利用了基础模型的强先验，最小化了可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习。

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer在脑肿瘤MRI分类中存在计算成本高、对对比度变化敏感、结构异质性和纹理不一致等挑战，需要开发更有效的混合框架。

Method: 提出CE-RS-SBCIT框架，包含四个核心创新：平滑边界CNN集成Transformer(SBCIT)、定制残差空间学习CNN、通道增强策略和新型空间注意力机制。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集上评估，涵盖胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%灵敏度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精确度。

Conclusion: 该混合框架通过整合局部细粒度特征和全局上下文信息，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，展现了卓越的分类性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

TL;DR: 使用隐式神经表示方法结合T1和T2加权MRI的优势，构建高分辨率各向同性MTL亚区图谱，提高阿尔茨海默病影像生物标志物的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于T2加权MRI的各向异性分辨率限制，难以准确提取内侧颞叶皮质亚区厚度，影响阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断和追踪

Method: 采用隐式神经表示方法，结合T1和T2加权MRI的分辨率优势，将各向异性空间的MTL亚区图谱上采样到各向同性空间，建立多模态高分辨率图谱集，并开发各向同性分割模型

Result: 在各向同性模型提取的皮质亚区厚度在区分轻度认知障碍和认知正常参与者方面显示出更高显著性，且在纵向分析中表现出更好的稳定性

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD影像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确测量

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗提示挖掘和样本校正提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测仅依赖图像级标签，容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：对抗提示挖掘（使用错误标签激活错误特征映射）和对抗样本校正（构建在线全局原型整合样本）

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上显著提升性能，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Method: 提出多模态伪标注方法：收集含多图像和标题的文档，排除事实不一致实例；基于黄金摘要分别对图像和标题排序；当图像和对应标题都排名第一时标注伪标签；移除包含直接图像引用的文档

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的多模态伪标注方法比单独考虑标题和图像的文本/图像伪标注方法构建的数据集更精确，生成的图像质量更高

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能够有效构建高质量的封面图像生成数据集，为同时生成文本摘要和视觉对应图像的任务提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Motivation: 为了解决高速公路场景中多模态感知任务的复杂性和计算效率之间的平衡问题，需要一种能够同时处理多种关键感知任务且适用于资源受限环境的框架。

Method: 采用混合专家策略，使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，然后指导小型高效VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）进行短视频推理和多模态分析。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态数据获取困难问题，在保持预测准确性的同时降低了数据获取成本，为IHC生物标记物预测提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合目标优化损失函数和预处理，能够提供高准确、计算高效的ALL自动诊断工具，有力加速临床诊断流程

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D扩散策略(DP3)的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，并能适应不同点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP是一个有效的4D视觉预训练框架，能够显著提升3D表示性能，适用于各种机器人任务，并可扩展到更大的视觉-语言-动作模型

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过视角编码(PE)和视角旋转(PR)技术，解决了裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真的问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致关节相对深度估计不准确，且人体偏离图像中心时会产生透视失真，增加了模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出视角编码(PE)来编码裁剪图像的相机内参，并提出视角旋转(PR)将人体置于图像中心以减少透视失真，结合两者构建PersPose框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到最先进性能，其中在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过有效处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测并移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有方法在浅层剪枝效果不佳，因为缺乏足够的上下文信息。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可独立于LVLM架构运行。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无训练剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为LVLM提供了可扩展且高效的推理效率提升方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，个人隐私面临严重威胁。现有的主动取证方法基于单一水印嵌入的理想假设，但在实际场景中，受保护图像可能遭受多次水印嵌入攻击，导致原始取证水印被破坏或移除，使整个主动取证机制失效。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟多嵌入攻击场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来强制学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示。该方法不修改网络架构，是一种即插即用的训练方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对多嵌入攻击的鲁棒性，使模型在遭受第二次水印嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: 多嵌入攻击是深度伪造主动取证中的一个实际威胁，本文提出的AIS方法有效解决了这一问题，为水印取证技术在实际应用中的可靠性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Conclusion: 该工作向基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈出了一步，通过模拟视觉皮层回路有效解决了深度神经网络感知错觉轮廓的局限性。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

*Sankalp Pandey,Xuan Bac Nguyen,Nicholas Borys,Hugh Churchill,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CLIFF框架，首个在二维材料领域系统研究持续学习的方法，通过冻结主干网络和基础头，为新材料学习特定提示、嵌入和增量头，实现材料分类并显著减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子薄片的自动层分类对可扩展量子硬件至关重要，但由于不同材料间外观差异大，传统光学显微镜分类面临挑战，需要能够持续学习新材料的方法。

Method: 冻结在参考材料上训练的主干网络和基础头，为每个新材料学习材料特定的提示、嵌入和增量头；使用提示池和余弦相似度门调制特征并计算材料特定修正；结合记忆回放和知识蒸馏。

Result: CLIFF实现了竞争性准确率，相比简单微调和基于提示的基线方法，遗忘显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了二维材料持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为量子薄片的自动化分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

*Zhenyu Liu,Huizhi Liang,Xinrun Li,Vaclav Snasel,Varun Ojha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态来提升目标模型的对抗鲁棒性，使用两个独立的损失函数使引导模型更积极参与反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗蒸馏方法使用可学习的引导模型时，由于引导模型从零开始学习，在协同训练过程中难以保持其最优状态以进行有效的知识传递。

Method: AdaGAT方法动态调整引导模型的训练状态，开发了两个独立的损失函数，使引导模型更积极地参与反向传播以达到最优状态。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上的实验表明，在适当精度范围内调整引导模型可以显著提升目标模型在各种对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过自适应调整引导模型状态，有效解决了对抗蒸馏中引导模型优化难题，显著提升了学生模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人-物交互对于以人为中心的视频内容理解至关重要，需要同时识别细粒度交互和追踪目标轨迹。

Method: 提出包含目标轨迹检测模块和交互推理模块的新方法，构建了包含10,831个时空交互实例的VidOR-HOID数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能上优于基于图像人-物交互检测、视频视觉关系检测和视频人-物交互识别的最新方法生成的基线。

Conclusion: 提出的ST-HOID任务和方法有效解决了视频中人-物交互的时空检测问题，为视频内容理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发深度学习模型来自动测量CT图像中的骨骼肌面积，实现肌少症的自动化评估和检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌少症与不良手术结果相关，但通过CT测量骨骼肌面积的过程耗时且增加临床工作量，限制了及时检测和管理

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习方法，使用标记和未标记的CT扫描数据集开发深度学习模型来测量骨骼肌面积

Result: 模型预测的骨骼肌面积平均误差为±3个百分点，预测掩模的平均Dice相似系数达到93%

Conclusion: 该方法展示了肌少症评估和检测完全自动化的可行途径，解决了类别不平衡和数据有限的问题

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

*Ruichao Hou,Boyue Xu,Tongwei Ren,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MTNet，一种基于Transformer的模态感知RGB-T跟踪器，通过通道聚合分布模块和空间相似性感知模块提取模态特征，使用Transformer融合全局依赖关系，并采用三叉预测头和动态更新策略实现精确跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规融合范式和固定跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互能力，需要更有效的多模态表示学习方法。

Method: 1) 模态感知网络(CADM和SSPM模块)提取模态特定线索；2) Transformer融合网络捕获全局依赖关系；3) 三叉预测头和动态更新策略处理尺度变化和变形问题。

Result: 在三个RGB-T基准测试中达到满意结果，与最先进方法相比表现优异，同时实现实时速度。

Conclusion: MTNet通过有效的模态感知和Transformer融合，显著提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如SAM在零样本图像分割方面表现优异，但在特定领域任务中表现不足，传统微调方法需要大量人工工作和领域专业知识

Method: 基于Quick-Tune超参数优化框架，使用元学习的成本和性能模型预测高性能配置，在超过2亿种可能性的搜索空间中高效导航

Conclusion: 研究证明了元学习在自动化模型适配专业分割任务方面的巨大潜力，为快速部署高质量分割模型提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Conclusion: 该综述为组合视觉推理研究提供了基础性参考，指明了未来发展方向，包括世界模型整合、人机协同推理等。

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoundDiff基础扩散模型，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法通常在特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理不同扫描条件下的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了临床应用的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）开发剂量-解剖感知对比学习模型(DA-CLIP)学习连续表示；2）设计剂量-解剖感知扩散模型(DA-Diff)，通过基于Mamba的条件块整合学习到的嵌入信息进行自适应去噪。

Result: 在两个公共低剂量CT数据集（包含8个剂量水平和3个解剖区域）上的实验表明，FoundDiff在去噪性能上优于现有最先进方法，并对未见过的剂量水平表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff作为一种基础扩散模型，能够实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一、可泛化的低剂量CT去噪，为解决临床场景中的多样性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型规模扩大，训练成本在内存和计算方面日益昂贵，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的编辑框架来实现定制化对象的插入编辑。

Method: 提出位置嵌入移植技术指导扩散模型忠实复制参考对象的结构特征，同时引入角点中心布局将参考图像和背景图像拼接作为FLUX.1-Fill模型输入，在渐进去噪过程中应用位置嵌入移植引导目标区域的噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge展示了其实用价值和广泛应用的潜力，为无需训练的定制化对象插入提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的光谱图像渲染，代码和数据将在接受后发布。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured

scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针和动态缓存轨迹对齐，在扩散模型中实现高效加速和更好的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在动态扩散过程中泛化性有限，对异常样本效果不佳。

Method: 提出DiCache框架：1）在线探针分析方案实时获取缓存误差先验，自主确定缓存时机；2）动态缓存轨迹对齐基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存，更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在多个领先扩散模型（WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成、Flux图像生成）上的实验表明，DiCache相比最先进方法实现了更高效率和改进的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: DiCache通过揭示浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出之间的强相关性，提供了一种统一的训练免费自适应缓存策略，有效解决了扩散模型加速中的"何时缓存"和"如何使用缓存"问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法为每种条件类型训练单独的控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源低效使用，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入并提高生成效率。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似的patch特征并分配给专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制实现主干网络和条件分支的有效交互。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种条件图像生成任务中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniGen框架通过创新的CoMoE和WeaveNet设计，有效解决了多条件图像生成中的特征纠缠和计算冗余问题，验证了其在多功能性和有效性方面的优势。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG方法能显著提升在具有挑战性的临床案例上的表现，但距离理想性能仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。标准RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传播到检索器，因此需要联合优化。

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行评估。

Result: 模型在多个任务上达到与医学预训练模型竞争的性能，联合检索优化显著改善了具有挑战性的案例，但实际性能与理想性能仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过检索到的图像实现，但当前方法性能与理想性能差距很大，前沿LVLM重新排序器也无法缩小这一差距，为未来方法留下了改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Result: 大量实验表明，MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人体视频方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCo通过解耦结构和外观生成，结合新构建的大规模全身人体视频数据集，有效解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性和结构连贯性问题。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Method: 提出T-VBI将SAM输出token重新参数化为潜在变量进行无训练变分贝叶斯推理，以及SO-KAN通过自监督学习优化token预测并剪枝冗余token。

Result: 在五个超声数据集上实现：实时推理（0.03秒/图像）、优异分割精度（平均DSC：剪枝版89.0% vs 原版88.0% vs MedSAM 88.3%）、识别出4个关键决策token。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的通用性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过从语义角度构建全面的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，有效改善了视觉-语言模型的零样本演绎性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Conclusion: FedKLPR有效解决了联邦学习在行人重识别中的统计异质性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了在保持感知质量的前提下，通过精心设计的压缩策略可以实现实时性能的扩散模型，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Conclusion: RefineEdit-Agent通过智能代理设计有效提升了编辑保真度和上下文保持能力，验证了其在复杂迭代图像编辑任务中的优越性

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

TL;DR: 本文提出了室内3D目标检测的跨数据集适应基准，分析了不同域差距对检测器性能的影响，并提供了改进适应性能的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测研究主要在相同分布的数据集上进行，缺乏对跨数据集适应能力的考察。不同室内点云数据集在采集方式、点云质量、边界框布局和实例特征等方面存在显著差异，导致检测器容易过拟合到特定数据集的特征。

Conclusion: 建立了室内3D目标检测域适应的综合基准，为未来开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的检测器提供了基础，推动了该领域向更实用的跨数据集应用发展。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

*Liyang Peng,Sihan Zhu,Yunjie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的双分支视频Transformer架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过跨模态融合机制显著提升复杂未修剪视频中的动作识别和定位性能，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的问题。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时序子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上达到40.5%的平均mAP，在THUMOS14上达到67.1%的mAP@0.5，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合多粒度语义指导和跨模态学习机制，显著提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，为复杂视频理解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of
data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research
focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions
between heterogeneous data modalities with distinct characteristics while
capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address
these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Motivation: 现有微调范式在过度自由和过度限制之间摇摆，导致可塑性与稳定性之间的权衡不佳。需要一种能够精细调节学习过程的方法来解决多模态跟踪器优化问题。

Method: 首先分析预训练权重的切空间来测量和定向先验敏感性以保持泛化能力，然后在调优阶段探索迁移敏感性以强调适应性和稳定性，将这些敏感性作为正则化项融入学习过程。

Result: 该方法显著提升了跨模态的可迁移性，在各种多模态跟踪任务中超越了当前最先进的技术。

Conclusion: 敏感性感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器微调中的可塑性-稳定性权衡问题，为预训练模型的多模态适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Motivation: 人类社交行为本质上是多模态的，需要强大的视听模型来进行感知。现有模型在处理社交互动数据方面存在局限性，因此需要开发专门针对社交场景的预训练模型。

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法，提出了一种标签效率更高的视觉Transformer训练方法，在仅使用10%标注数据的情况下达到可比性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习中DINO对数据增强敏感和Barlow Twins需要大批次的问题，利用两种方法的互补优势，在资源受限环境下实现高效训练

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用10%标注数据进行线性探测训练

Result: 混合方法在损失和分类准确率上与DINO相当，同时保持强特征表示能力，注意力可视化显示改进的语义分割能力

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了可扩展、标签高效的替代方案

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，且很少整合影像数据和语言信息。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优，使用来自60个公共数据集的22万MRI体积和1900万MRI切片的大规模异构语料库。

Result: 定性结果表明OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多种任务，包括MRI重建、解剖和病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一成像和临床语言的端到端MRI解释奠定了基础。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Conclusion: 研究未发现RadImageNet预训练在ACL撕裂和乳腺病变分类任务中提供优于ImageNet预训练的性能证据，但确定了ResNet50架构配合部分解冻策略的最优配置。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Result: 实验证明IDU管道显著减少更新时间和人力成本

Conclusion: IDU为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的目标化3D模型维护解决方案

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉语言微调方法，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合与LLM各层语义粒度对应的分层特征，避免序列扩展问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接会导致输入序列长度显著增加，造成大量计算开销。现有融合方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息

Method: 利用视觉编码器和语言模型的固有分层表示特性，通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM相应层的FFN中

Result: 在各种VL基准测试中，包括ScienceQA的视觉问答和COCO Captions的图像描述，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确性，同时保持了高效的训练和推理

Conclusion: DEHVF方法通过仅微调少量参数，实现了相同语义粒度下跨模态信息的精确对齐和互补，有效解决了现有视觉语言模型中的序列扩展和计算效率问题

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象的分层策略，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理速度

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Result: 64M参数基础模型在AI City Challenge 2025 Track 3中获得66.8861分，排名第五；80M参数变体在空间推理任务上表现更佳

Conclusion: TinyGiantVLM有效弥合了视觉感知与空间理解之间的差距，在工业环境中展现出强大的空间推理能力，轻量级设计使其具有实用价值

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中实体及其复杂交互关系控制的挑战，现有扩散模型难以有效控制实体和交互以生成高质量图像

Method: 1) 基于大语言模型的实体交互关系挖掘；2) 交互动作聚类和偏移方法；3) 实体控制网络生成语义引导的掩码并融合特征

Result: 实验表明CEIDM在实体控制和交互控制方面优于现有代表性方法

Conclusion: CEIDM通过双重控制机制有效提升了文本到图像生成中实体和交互关系的控制能力，生成更符合现实逻辑的高质量图像

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Motivation: 开发一个非物种特定的快速动物个体识别算法，以解决野生动物保护和研究中的个体识别需求

Method: 提出两种基于关键点（热点）提取和匹配的方法：1）顺序匹配查询图像与数据库图像；2）基于快速最近邻搜索和竞争性评分机制的匹配方法

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出色，具有快速、准确和多物种适用的特点

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

Motivation: 解决传统深度视觉语音识别系统计算成本高、硬件资源需求大的问题，以推进VSR系统在资源受限的实际应用场景中的部署和采用。

Method: 采用标准的双网络设计范式：一个网络处理视觉特征提取，另一个网络利用特征进行序列分类。首先对图像分类领域的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时序卷积网络背榜中采用轻量级块设计。

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了质量轻、性能强的视觉语音识别模型，有效解决了传统深度模型资源消耗大的问题，推进了VSR系统在实际应用场景中的应用。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出基于加权Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子分数，通过子分数特异性损失加权提升预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测ADAS-Cog总分，但忽略了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同认知领域，某些子分数对总分的确定具有更大影响

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权对MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者效果更好，中等加权对变异度较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 统一加权未充分利用关键子分数并限制泛化能力，提出的框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码，对服装属性控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差，需要突破这些限制。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，将参考人物图像和目标服装图像通过专用条件路径融入去噪过程，采用双向生成策略构建数据集，包括掩码模型生成参考图像和自监督训练的对称"Try-Off"模型恢复服装图像。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态融合和数据集构建方法，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统的关键限制，为真实场景应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了子项分数的预测价值，这些子项能捕捉特定领域的认知衰退。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer架构提取MRI影像特征，与纵向临床数据融合，采用多任务学习框架同时预测总分和13个子项分数。

Result: 子项学习提升了总分预测性能，Q1、Q4、Q8等子项对总分预测贡献最大，但部分重要子项预测误差较高，存在临床特征主导问题。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项信息建模的价值，指出需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来实现更平衡的学习，构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Motivation: 现有的少样本目标计数和检测方法主要关注目标类别，往往无法准确定位非目标模式，且将目标样本表示为空间坍缩的原型会丢失结构信息。

Method: 重新审视经典的模板匹配和回归方法，在冻结的主干网络顶部添加少量可学习的卷积或投影层，有效保留和利用样本的空间布局信息。

Conclusion: 提出的TMR方法通过简单的模板匹配和回归结构，在少样本模式检测任务中取得了优异性能，同时引入了更全面的RPINE数据集来评估非目标模式检测能力。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数能够有效解决纵向多硬化症疵痕分割中的数据不平衡问题，在保持高分割精度的同时确保各项指标的均衡表现。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Conclusion: 该研究为基于点云的管状结构重建设立了新基准，提出的方法和数据集对医学影像和计算机辅助诊断具有重要意义。

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

TL;DR: 提出了M^3-GloDet框架，系统评估肾小球检测模型在不同区域、尺度和疾病类别下的性能，发现中等尺寸图像块和适度放大倍数能取得最佳平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉检测算法主要关注正常肾小球或全局硬化病例，对多种疾病亚型的检测研究不足，且缺乏对最佳成像放大倍数和视野尺寸的系统研究

Method: 开发M^3-GloDet系统框架，评估传统基准架构和最新SOTA模型，采用反映实际数字肾脏病理学中不同感兴趣区域大小和成像分辨率的实验设计

Result: 中等尺寸的图像块在上下文信息与计算效率之间取得最佳平衡；适度放大倍数通过减少过拟合提高了模型的泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过系统比较多类疾病肾小球数据集上的检测方法，为改进自动化检测策略和临床工作流程提供了实用见解，推动了数字病理学领域的发展

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Motivation: 在可信医疗诊断系统中，需要检测分布外(OOD)样本以识别未知疾病，避免误诊风险。现有方法在处理与已知疾病相似的未知疾病时面临挑战

Method: 基于视觉语言模型，提出跨尺度视觉融合策略整合多尺度视觉信息，并设计跨尺度硬伪OOD样本生成策略来增强检测能力

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的实验表明，该框架相比现有方法取得了更优的OOD检测性能

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架通过有效整合多尺度视觉信息和生成伪OOD样本，显著提升了医学图像中未知疾病的检测能力

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Conclusion: LGTTP是模型无关的高效框架，在处理显式时间标记查询方面表现优异，同时适用于通用视频理解任务

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了transformer、扩散模型和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发的transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在服装动态重建中存在平滑几何细节缺失和顶点位移变形产生伪影的问题，需要一种能够准确建模高频细节和动态变形的方法。

Method: 提出神经梯度变形方法(NGD)，结合自适应网格重划分策略处理动态表面演化，并学习动态纹理映射来捕捉光照和阴影效果。

Result: 通过大量定性和定量评估，证明该方法相比现有SOTA方法有显著改进，能够实现高质量的服装重建。

Conclusion: NGD方法有效解决了动态服装重建中的细节建模和变形处理问题，为单目视频中的高质量服装重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Motivation: 传统对话检索方法无法满足用户在长对话中查找语义连贯内容的需求，需要开发能够从多模态长对话中精确检索相关片段的新方法。

Result: F2RVLM在领域内和真实场景下均优于主流视觉语言模型，展现出优异的检索性能。

Conclusion: FFR任务填补了多模态长对话检索的空白，F2RVLM通过创新的训练范式有效解决了语义连贯性挑战，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Conclusion: 该框架为实时偏好对齐图像生成提供了有效解决方案，开启了对话式生成和MLLM与扩散模型集成的新可能性

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 该框架为少样本人类动作异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过统一的表示空间和生成增强策略，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和实用性

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Result: 分割图像使精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，但整体提升有限

Conclusion: 分割有助于特征提取但对分类性能影响有限，该框架可作为临床辅助诊断工具

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其社会偏见和人类刻板印象的传播机制，了解预训练阶段的偏见如何影响下游应用。

Method: 采用全面的实证分析方法：1) 比较全局和局部数据视图下的预训练偏见变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见的关联性；3) 探究偏见传播不一致性的原因。

Result: 研究发现：偏见测量对计算所用的数据子集高度敏感；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；不同预训练CLIP模型在适应下游任务时表征空间趋于收敛。

Conclusion: 当前范式下偏见传播存在不一致性，该研究为理解偏见行为提供了重要见解，有助于未来开发更好的偏见缓解实践。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Motivation: 现有细胞分割网络（如Cellpose、Stardist、HoverNet）虽然精度高，但依赖完全标注的数据集，这限制了训练集的生成和迁移学习

Method: 开发了一种仍基于距离映射但能处理部分标注对象的方法，并集成到用户友好的Napari插件中

Result: 在节约学习、迁移学习和常规学习场景下的实验表明，该方法能显著节省时间和资源，且不牺牲分割质量

Conclusion: 该方法解决了完全标注数据集的限制问题，为细胞分割提供了更高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在最小计算开销下显著提升了视觉标记剪枝的性能

Conclusion: 该简单有效的方法可以消除视觉标记剪枝中的近期偏差，为视觉-语言模型提供了一种高效的计算优化方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Result: 通过大量实验证明该方法在生成真实室内场景方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该工作推动了场景生成领域的发展，为需要详细3D环境的应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Conclusion: SCOUT方法通过有效利用未标注数据和文本信息，显著提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过拟合，但传统标签平滑反而会削弱提示调优的泛化能力。

Method: 提出交替训练标签平滑(ATLaS)方法，交替使用标准one-hot标签和软标签进行训练。引入两种高效的离线软标签：类间软标签(CSL)和实例级软标签(ISL)，为提示调优提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明，ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能够持续提升提示调优的泛化性能。该方法与主流提示调优方法具有高度兼容性，可以无缝集成到现有方法中。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了传统标签平滑在提示调优中的局限性，通过交替训练策略和高效的软标签设计，显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力，且具有良好的兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Conclusion: 提出的类平衡采样和软伪标签策略有效解决了框级主动学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了目标检测模型的性能

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: VISA方法能有效压缩视觉token同时保留更多信息，为多模态大语言模型提供了高效的推理解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种轻量级且灵活的相机位姿精炼解决方案，可直接应用于各种场景而无需额外训练，显著提升了位姿估计精度

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

*Raul Balmez,Alexandru Brateanu,Ciprian Orhei,Codruta Ancuti,Cosmin Ancuti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISALux是一个基于Transformer的低光照图像增强方法，通过整合光照和语义先验，采用混合光照语义感知自注意力机制和MoE前馈网络来提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中光照和语义信息整合不足的问题，以及现有方法在基准数据集上由于不同光照模式导致的过拟合问题。

Method: 提出HISA-MSA自注意力模块分别处理光照和语义特征，使用MoE-based FFN增强上下文学习，并采用LoRA技术防止过拟合。

Result: 在多个专业数据集上的定性和定量评估表明，ISALux与最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，在低光照图像增强任务中表现出色，各组件均对性能提升有重要贡献。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniAPO是首个针对多模态自动提示优化的统一框架，通过EM式优化过程和长短时记忆机制，解决了视觉token膨胀和过程级监督缺失的问题，在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本输入，在多模态任务（如视频-语言生成）中存在两个核心挑战：视觉token膨胀导致上下文容量受限和反馈信号不足，以及缺乏过程级监督限制了提示优化的效果。

Method: UniAPO采用EM启发的优化过程，将反馈建模和提示优化解耦，使优化更稳定和目标驱动。引入长短时记忆机制：历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示为有效提示优化提供方向性指导。

Result: UniAPO在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致的性能提升，建立了高效且可迁移的提示优化统一框架。

Conclusion: UniAPO成功解决了多模态自动提示优化中的关键挑战，为多模态任务提供了有效的提示优化解决方案，具有很好的通用性和迁移性。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the
development of AI medical assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用刚性流水线，将推理与感知解耦，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下，无法根据具体查询需求自适应提取视觉证据

Method: CAVIA采用三层创新：1）分层推理引导精确定位到具体帧；2）跨模态语义桥接实现目标提取；3）置信度驱动的迭代合成，形成推理持续指导视觉提取的闭环系统

Result: 在EgoSchema（65.7%，+5.3%）、NExT-QA（76.1%，+2.6%）和IntentQA（73.8%，+6.9%）三个挑战性基准上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，证明通过推理持续指导视觉提取能显著提升视频理解能力

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过将体积上下文信息融入伪影减少任务来提高模型性能，特别是在临床CT扫描的稀疏采样条纹伪影校正方面。

Method: 使用22名受试者的CT数据，通过Astra工具箱模拟平行、扇形和锥形光束几何形状的稀疏采样CT体积。训练和验证2D和3D U-Net模型，比较2D、2.5D和3D输入数据维度的性能。

Conclusion: 2D U-Net在轴向切片上的处理方式在稀疏采样条纹伪影校正任务中表现最佳，表明在此特定任务中，2D方法比包含更多维度信息的方法更有效。

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Motivation: 现有的场景回归方法（如VGGT）在处理极端视角变化的图像时表现出色，但无法有效处理大量输入图像。为了解决大规模SfM问题，需要开发能够高效处理大量图像的方法。

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后对回归网络进行微调，使其能够基于该神经场景表示重建所有输入图像。采用前馈Transformer架构，结合视觉定位能力。

Result: 该方法不仅能够高效扩展到大规模场景，还在TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2和Tanks & Temples等多个基准测试中，在相机姿态估计和新视角合成方面取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过引入视觉定位能力增强了场景回归网络，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，在多个标准数据集上表现出优异的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Conclusion: 通过语义推理与法医分析的协同结合，实现了全面的检测准确性和定位精度

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏框架CDD：1)域特定训练：将训练集划分为多个异常比例较低的域，为每个域训练特定学生模型；2)跨域知识聚合：利用域特定学生生成的伪正常特征协同指导全局学生学习跨样本的泛化正常表示

Conclusion: CDD框架有效解决了FUAD设置下知识蒸馏的异常学习问题，验证了跨域知识聚合在完全无监督异常检测中的有效性

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Motivation: 视觉异常检测在医学等领域至关重要，但随时间变化的数据分布会显著降低模型性能。医学影像数据具有动态演进特性，持续学习提供了一个自然有效的框架来增量适应模型同时保留已有知识。

Method: 使用持续学习版本的PatchCore模型（PatchCoreCL），在具有图像级和像素级标注的真实医学影像数据集BMAD上进行评估。

Result: PatchCoreCL是一个有效的解决方案，实现了与任务特定模型相当的性能，遗忘值小于1%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了持续学习在医学影像自适应视觉异常检测中的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Conclusion: 首次使用2D X射线作为颅骨表示进行颅面重建，为法医鉴定提供了创新的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和提出的VisCog-Bench基准测试上分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过多阶段推理和即时奖励机制有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和准确性，特别是在处理复杂和模糊提示方面表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

TL;DR: ArgusCogito是一个受百眼巨人感知策略启发的零样本思维链框架，通过跨模态协同和全方位推理，在伪装目标分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标分割方法存在浅层特征表示、推理机制不足和跨模态整合弱的问题，导致目标分离不完整和分割不精确。受百眼巨人整体观察、全方位聚焦和深度审视策略的启发，需要开发能够深度认知的模型。

Method: 提出ArgusCogito框架，包含三个认知启发阶段：1)猜想阶段-通过跨模态融合进行全局推理构建认知先验；2)聚焦阶段-进行全方位注意力驱动扫描和聚焦推理；3)雕刻阶段-在聚焦区域内迭代生成密集点提示来逐步雕刻高保真分割掩码。

Result: 在四个伪装目标分割基准和三个医学图像分割基准上的广泛评估表明，ArgusCogito实现了最先进的性能，验证了框架的卓越效能、优越泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ArgusCogito通过跨模态协同和全方位推理的认知启发框架，成功解决了伪装目标分割的挑战，展现了出色的分割性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级脉冲网络去噪，能够高效地从3D场景生成高保真的事件序列，速度达到4分钟/秒720p视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声的RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间频率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染过程，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络对生成的RGB视频去噪。网络使用双极性泄漏积分发放（BiLIF）脉冲单元和双向地球移动距离（EMD）损失来捕捉事件流的物理特性。

Result: EventTracer在720p视频上运行速度约为4分钟/秒，继承了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势。在两个下游任务中显示出比其他事件模拟器更好的场景细节捕捉能力和与真实事件数据的相似性。

Conclusion: EventTracer是一个有前景的工具，能够以低成本创建大规模事件-RGB数据集，缩小事件视觉中的模拟到真实差距，并推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等各种应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Motivation: 当前的开集高光谱图像分类方法主要关注从已知类别中区分并拒绝未知类别样本，但无法进一步识别或发现未知类别。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用原型学习和聚类方法，通过少量标注样本学习已知类别分类器，同时推断未知类别的原型，然后根据与未知类别原型的距离对未知样本进行聚类。

Result: 在四个基准高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在开集少样本高光谱图像分类任务中表现出具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效区分已知和未知类别，还能进一步发现和识别未知类别，为开集少样本高光谱图像分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Motivation: 旨在统一基于分数的生成模型（SGMs/扩散模型）和薛定谔桥（SB）问题，解决SB模型训练困难和效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出了三种重参数化技术：迭代比例均值匹配（IPMM）、迭代比例终点匹配（IPTM）和迭代比例流匹配（IPFM），以及使用预训练SGMs初始化SB模型的策略。

Result: 实验证明这些方法显著加速和稳定了SB模型的训练，同时结合了SB模型和SGMs的优势，进一步提升了生成模型的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成模型的未来研究做出了贡献并铺平了道路，实现了两种重要生成模型的统一和性能提升。

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Motivation: CAM是深度学习模型可视化的重要方法，但其对不同噪声的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估各种CAM方法在噪声扰动下的表现。

Method: 通过分析不同类型噪声对CAM解释的影响，评估CAM对噪声的敏感性，并提出包含一致性和响应性的鲁棒性度量指标，在多个架构和数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 研究发现不同CAM方法对噪声的敏感性存在显著差异，提出的鲁棒性度量能够有效捕捉CAM方法在噪声扰动下的稳定性和敏感性特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为CAM方法的鲁棒性评估提供了系统框架和度量标准，揭示了不同CAM方法在噪声环境下的性能差异，对提高模型解释的可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有的视觉引导图像编辑评估过于简单，不足以代表真实世界的编辑挑战，需要更全面的基准测试来系统评估不同生成模型的性能。

Method: 开发了SpotEdit基准测试，包含多样化评估场景和专门的幻觉检测组件，测试了扩散模型、自回归模型和混合生成模型。

Result: 发现不同模型之间存在显著的性能差异，领先模型如GPT-4o经常出现幻觉问题，错误地认为存在视觉提示并执行编辑任务。

Conclusion: SpotEdit基准测试揭示了当前视觉引导图像编辑方法的局限性，特别是幻觉问题，为未来研究提供了重要的评估框架。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: BRAIN方法有效解决了脑信号衰减和表示偏移问题，通过偏差缓解和知识保持机制显著提升了视觉-大脑理解模型的性能

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

Result: 在遮挡情况下产生准确、鲁棒和一致的重建结果，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的优化指导设计，实现了高质量的手持物体3D重建，确保了物理合理的手-物体交互

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算成本高，难以在延迟敏感的应用（如自动驾驶）中部署，需要一种既能加速推理又能保持性能的方法。

Method: 采用度量引导的贪婪块选择策略，利用准确度等指标反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过可调节的稀疏度-性能平衡目标支持不同部署需求。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，GM-Skip将Person类别的单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升到87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在自动驾驶系统中实现45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架有效加速了视觉语言模型的推理速度，在多个任务和数据集上保持性能，在真实世界部署中验证了其实用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，选择性消除文本到图像扩散模型中的后门攻击关联，在保持图像质量的同时有效防御文本触发器的恶意操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型存在后门攻击漏洞，攻击者可通过注入不可察觉的文本触发器操纵模型输出。现有防御方法主要针对分类模型，生成模型缺乏有效的后门防御技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)方法，利用知识蒸馏指导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，同时保持模型在无触发器时的正常输出能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有方法，对像素后门的移除准确率达到100%，对基于风格攻击的移除准确率达到93%，且不牺牲模型鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法为文本到图像扩散模型提供了有效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的可解释评估框架，通过识别可解释视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成内容提供细粒度评估，包括提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容（如合成图像）质量评估指标过于粗糙，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和开发，阻碍了科学理解和商业部署。

Method: 引入Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释视觉模式并自动用自然语言描述。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够揭示现有指标无法发现的细微模型差异，如FLUX的物理合理性优势和SDXL-medium的内容多样性优势，并与人类判断一致。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求相结合，为生成AI模型用户提供了强大的工具，用于模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进，直接满足公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全需求。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级Transformer模型，可从单摄像头2D关节点序列估计3D姿态，支持标定和非标定场景，通过掩码机制处理缺失先验信息，在精度和计算效率上均有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D姿态估计方法对相机标定和完整先验信息的依赖，开发一个既能适应实验室标定环境又能处理野外单目视频的通用模型

Method: 使用Transformer架构，输入包括2D关节点序列、段长度和相机内参等几何先验，通过掩码机制处理缺失先验，在AMASS数据集上训练并生成合成2D数据

Result: 平均3D关节中心位置估计精度达到36mm，比现有技术提升0.5厘米，GPU推理时间380μs，CPU推理时间1800μs，通用模型在完整和缺失先验情况下均优于专家模型

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个高效、轻量且通用的3D姿态估计解决方案，适用于从标定实验室到非标定野外场景的多种部署环境，特别适合嵌入式平台和低功耗设备

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化三个步骤，实现无需修改、重训练或额外参考图像的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要复杂的场景表示或大量参考图像，而3DGS作为一种新兴的显式场景表示方法，具有高效渲染的优势，但尚未被充分用于视觉定位任务。

Method: 方法分为三个步骤：1) 通过下采样和编码3D高斯生成场景特征；2) 编码图像块获取图像特征；3) 进行粗匹配、精匹配，最后通过姿态细化获得精确的相机位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功地将3DGS场景表示应用于视觉定位任务，证明了其在不需修改场景表示、重训练或额外参考图像的情况下实现高效定位的能力，为3DGS在更广泛视觉任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MMTok方法，利用多模态信息（视觉和文本标记）通过覆盖准则来选择信息丰富的视觉标记，显著提升视觉语言模型的推理效率，在保持性能的同时实现1.87倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉标记处理中存在冗余，导致推理效率低下。大多数方法仅使用单模态信息进行剪枝，忽略了视觉语言任务固有的多模态特性，且缺乏适用于不同模态的通用准则。

Method: 将子集选择问题建模为最大覆盖问题，优化视觉标记子集以同时覆盖文本标记和原始视觉标记集。采用VLM代理进一步改进文本标记质量来指导视觉剪枝。

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍加速，保持LLaVA-NeXT-13B模型98.7%的原始性能；仅用4个视觉标记仍能保持LLaVA-1.5-7B模型87.7%的原始性能。

Conclusion: 视觉和文本信息具有互补性，结合多模态信息能显著超越单模态基线。覆盖准则在标记选择中非常有效，为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态模型在推理能力、效率和部署方面的挑战，开发一个更强大、高效且开源的多模态模型系列，缩小与商业模型的性能差距。

Method: 采用Cascade Reinforcement Learning（Cascade RL）两阶段训练框架（离线RL稳定收敛+在线RL精细对齐）、Visual Resolution Router（ViR）动态调整视觉标记分辨率、Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment（DvD）策略分离视觉编码器和语言模型到不同GPU。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架、效率优化策略和部署方案，成功提升了多模态模型的推理能力和效率，为开源社区提供了接近商业模型性能的强大工具。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D修复方法依赖多视角2D图像修复，导致不同修复视图之间存在不一致性，产生模糊纹理、空间不连续性和视觉伪影，影响3D对象完成的准确性和真实感。

Method: 提出ObjFiller-3D方法，利用最先进的视频编辑模型来填充3D对象的掩码区域。分析了3D和视频之间的表示差距，将视频修复模型适配用于3D场景修复，并引入了基于参考的3D修复方法以进一步提升重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界的3D编辑应用中展现出强大的实际部署潜力，为解决3D修复中的一致性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Motivation: 手动设计高质量提示需要大量领域专业知识且难以扩展，现有自动优化方法要么计算成本高（过度探索），要么容易陷入局部最优（过度利用）。

Method: 使用多智能体协作工作流：分析代理通过主题建模识别错误模式，生成代理针对性修订提示，在遗传算法框架下通过交叉和变异操作进化候选提示。

Conclusion: GreenTEA通过智能平衡探索与利用，提供了一种高效且有效的自动提示优化解决方案，显著提升了LLM在各种任务上的性能。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

Result: 计算成本降低34%，专业判断任务一致性提升23%，专家级评估准确率提高18%

Conclusion: 将认知科学原理与AI系统设计结合，为LLMs提供了自适应的原则性推理方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 收集文献中的多样化验证器方法，包括基于提示的验证器、微调的判别式或生成式模型，对验证器训练、类型和用途进行统一分类和分析。

Conclusion: 验证器在测试时缩放中作为参数无关的推理扩展方法表现出色，本文的系统综述为研究者提供了全面的技术路线图和实践指导。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

Motivation: 探究CoT推理痕迹是否必须具有语义可解释性才能提升LLM任务性能，挑战了当前关于推理痕迹需要人类可理解的隐含假设

Method: 在开放书籍问答领域，使用四种类型的推理痕迹对LLaMA和Qwen模型进行监督微调：1) DeepSeek R1痕迹 2) R1痕迹的LLM生成摘要 3) R1痕迹的LLM生成事后解释 4) 算法生成的可验证正确痕迹，并进行100人参与的人类可解释性评估

Result: DeepSeek R1痕迹微调获得最强性能，但被人类参与者评为最不可解释；可解释性更高的痕迹类型反而性能较差

Conclusion: 中间标记与最终用户可解释性可以解耦，性能最佳的推理痕迹不一定需要人类可解释

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的先进推理能力导致幻觉问题加剧，现有缓解方法主要关注事后过滤而非主动干预触发幻觉的查询本身。

Method: 提出QueryBandits框架，使用多臂老虎机算法设计重写策略，基于17个语言特征的敏感性来最大化奖励模型，主动引导LLM避免生成幻觉内容。

Result: 在13个多样化QA基准测试和1050个词汇扰动查询上，Thompson Sampling版本的QueryBandits相比无重写基线获得87.5%的胜率，比零样本静态提示方法分别高出42.6%和60.3%。

Conclusion: QueryBandits通过查询重写干预有效缓解幻觉问题，证明静态重写策略可能加剧幻觉，而基于语义特征的引导重写可以显著改变输出行为，无需重新训练或基于梯度的适配。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在迷宫测试中显示出某些意识相关行为，但缺乏持续的自我意识集成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过迷宫测试来探索大语言模型的意识相关行为，包括空间感知、视角采取、目标导向行为和时序排列等关键特征

Method: 将意识理论汇总为13个核心特征，在零样本、单样本和少样本学习场景下评估12个领先的大语言模型

Result: 理解能力强的LLM表现更优，Gemini 2.0 Pro达到52.9%完整路径准确率，DeepSeek-R1达到80.5%部分路径准确率，但模型在解决过程中无法保持一质的自我模型

Conclusion: 虽然大语言模型通过理解机制在意识相关行为方面取得进步，但仍缺乏集成性、持续性的自我意识这一意识的核心特征

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

TL;DR: 通过自我知识萌化实现密集和稀疏表征的双向学习，在保持稀疏模型优势的同时达到了与密集模型相当的检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态稀疏检索方法依赖计算成本高的对比预训练或矩阵萌化，并发现密集和稀疏表征间的相互增强潜力受限

Method: 提出基于自我知识萌化的框架，使用密集和稀疏相似度的加权汇总作为共享的教师信号，实现双向学习，仅微调密集编码器最后一层和稀疏投影头

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据集上，稀疏检索器不仅超过现有稀疏基线，而且达到了与密集模型相当或更好的性能，同时保持了稀疏模型的优势

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效地实现密集和稀疏表征的相互增强，为多模态检索提供了一种简单但有效的方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了错误反思提示（ERP）方法，在思维链（CoT）基础上增加错误识别和修正能力，使语言模型能够自我识别错误类型和错误步骤，提升推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链（CoT）提示方法缺乏反思和纠错能力，容易导致模型持续犯错。受人类反思能力的启发，需要开发能够识别和修正错误的新方法。

Method: 在CoT基础上构建ERP方法，包含三个步骤：错误答案生成、错误识别、正确答案生成。通过自动化ERP生成，模型能够自我识别错误类型和导致错误的步骤。

Result: ERP作为传统CoT的有效补充，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力，增强了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性，使模型能够更好地理解错误产生的原因。

Conclusion: 错误反思提示（ERP）方法成功解决了CoT缺乏反思能力的问题，为语言模型提供了更强大的推理和错误修正能力，具有很好的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

TL;DR: GAICo是一个开源的Python库，用于标准化和简化生成式AI输出的比较评估，支持多模态和多格式数据，提供统一的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在关键领域的快速应用需要可靠且可复现的评估方法，但现有方法缺乏标准化，难以处理结构化输出和多模态比较。

Method: 开发了GAICo库，提供高层API和直接指标访问，支持文本、结构化数据和多媒体格式的参考基准评估。

Result: 通过AI旅行助手案例研究验证了工具实用性，发布后短时间内获得超过1.3万次下载，显示社区高度关注。

Conclusion: GAICo能够帮助研究者和开发者高效评估系统性能，提高开发速度，构建更可信的AI系统，实现更快更安全的AI部署。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,
across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Motivation: 通过受控公平比较，确定LLM重排序器与轻量级方法在性能上是否存在差异，特别是在新查询上的表现，并阐明观察到的差异的根本原因

Method: 在TREC DL19、DL20、BEIR等基准测试以及专门设计用于测试预训练模型未见查询的新数据集上，系统评估了40种重排序方法变体，分析训练数据重叠、模型架构和计算效率等因素

Result: LLM重排序器在熟悉查询上表现优异，但在新查询上的泛化能力存在差异，轻量级模型提供相当的效率。查询的新颖性显著影响重排序效果

Conclusion: 现有方法在处理新查询时存在局限性，需要开发更具泛化能力的重排序方法，平衡性能和效率

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 首次通过多模态故事生成任务系统评估视觉语言模型的文化能力，发现模型在文化适应方面存在显著差异和局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在不同文化背景中的广泛部署，确保其文化能力对于负责任的AI系统至关重要，但目前缺乏对多模态生成任务中文化认同线索的系统评估

Method: 开发了一个新颖的多模态框架，通过扰动文化身份来评估5个当代视觉语言模型在故事生成任务中的表现，包括跨模态评估和人工评估

Result: 模型展现出显著的文化适应能力，具有丰富的文化特定词汇，但文化能力在不同架构间差异巨大，部分模型出现逆向文化对齐，自动指标与人工评估存在矛盾

Conclusion: 研究确立了多模态AI文化能力的潜力和挑战，视觉文化理解仍然有限，需要进一步改进模型的文化敏感性

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly
release our codebase and data: https://github.com/ArkaMukherjee0/mmCultural

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新框架MH-COPILOT，通过识别缺失的支持属性并提示用户补充信息，来提高在线心理健康社区中帖子的回复率和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线心理健康社区中许多帖子因缺乏关键支持属性而无人回复，需要一种方法来识别这些缺失信息并提示用户补充。

Method: 研究者首先创建了REDDME数据集，标注了三个关键支持属性（事件、影响、需求）的范围和强度，提出了层次分类法CueTaxo，并设计了基于强化学习的MH-COPILOT系统，包括属性识别、强度分类、控制问题生成和验证器奖励模型。

Result: 在四个语言模型上的实验结果显示，该方法在属性引导和用户参与度方面取得了显著改善。人工评估进一步验证了模型在真实在线心理健康社区环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: MH-COPILOT框架能够有效地识别并引导用户补充缺失的支持属性，显著提高了在线心理健康社区中帖子的回复率和用户互动，为提供更好的同伴支持提供了新的技术手段。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReProCon是一个用于生物医学领域少样本命名实体识别的新框架，通过多原型建模、余弦对比学习和元学习来解决数据稀缺和标签不平衡问题，在资源有限环境下达到接近BERT的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域的命名实体识别面临数据稀缺和标签分布不平衡的挑战，特别是细粒度实体类型识别困难。

Method: 结合多原型建模（捕捉语义变异性）、余弦对比学习（确保类间分离）和Reptile元学习（快速适应少数据），使用轻量级的fastText + BiLSTM编码器。

Result: 在Few-NERD数据集上，macro-F1分数接近BERT基线（约99%性能），标签预算30%时保持稳定，从19类扩展到50类时F1仅下降7.8%，优于SpanProto和CONTaiNER等基线方法。

Conclusion: ReProCon在资源受限环境下表现出最先进的性能，适用于生物医学应用，尽管在标签模糊性方面仍有困难，但多原型建模和对比学习对处理类别不平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究LLM幻觉出的虚假语法结构，通过行为探测和元语言探测发现模型确实会幻觉构造，并通过假设测试模拟显示这些虚假假设会被高度确认，揭示了构造探测方法存在确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否会产生人类直觉不支持的虚假语法结构构造，探索模型隐含和显式语言知识中的幻觉现象。

Method: 使用上下文嵌入的行为探测任务和基于提示的元语言探测任务，区分隐式和显式语言知识；通过模拟假设测试来验证虚假构造假设的确认程度。

Result: 两种方法都显示模型确实会幻觉构造；模拟测试显示虚假假设会获得高准确率确认，表明构造探测方法存在严重的确认偏误。

Conclusion: 构造探测方法容易受到确认偏误影响，这引发了对模型可能拥有的未知和不正确句法知识的担忧。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

Motivation: 之前的研究显示，生成问题中的前提假设会引入未经验证的假设，导致声明验证的不一致性。同时提示敏感性仍是大语言模型的重要挑战，性能波动达到3-6%。

Method: 提出一种结构化且稳健的声明验证框架，通过推理避免前提假设的分解问题来进行验证。

Result: 在多种提示、数据集和大语言模型上进行的广泛实验显示，即使是最先进的模型仍然容易受到提示变化和前提假设的影响。方法一致地缓解了这些问题，实现了最高2-5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性仍然是一个持续性问题，本文提出的方法能够有效减少前提假设和提示变化带来的负面影响，提高声明验证的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限场景中部署受限，传统基于token级别的监督难以有效捕捉教师模型的全面推理能力，多路径蒸馏中路径质量参差不齐且处理方式单一。

Method: 提出QR-Distill方法：1）质量过滤保留LLM评估的正确推理路径；2）条件路由根据学生学习状态动态分配路径；3）协作同伴教学让学生相互蒸馏多样化见解。

Result: 实验表明QR-Distill优于传统单路径和多路径蒸馏方法，消融研究验证了质量过滤、条件路由和同伴教学各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: QR-Distill通过综合的质量评估、动态路径分配和协作学习机制，实现了更有效的知识转移，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型Transformer语言模型在各种下游任务中表现出色，但对其如何内化语言学知识的理解有限，需要跨语言的句法评估基准来促进研究。

Method: 利用QFrCoLA数据集和其他七个语言学二元可接受性判断语料库，对七个语言模型进行基准测试，包括微调的Transformer模型和零样本分类的大语言模型。

Result: 微调的Transformer模型在大多数语言中表现强劲，而零样本大语言模型表现较差。对于QFrCoLA基准，微调Transformer模型优于其他方法，且预训练跨语言LLM未显示出对魁北克法语的语言判断能力。

Conclusion: QFrCoLA是一个具有挑战性的数据集，能够有效基准测试语言模型的语言学判断能力，其基于语言学规范而非说话者感受的构建方式使其类似于语言学可接受性判断。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

Motivation: 法律文本简化需要专门评估语义保持的方法，因为法律领域的语义保持与普通文本有显著差异，需要确保简化后的文本准确性和可访问性

Method: 提出FrJUDGE数据集来评估法律文本间的语义保持，并开发JUDGEBERT评估指标专门用于法语法律文本简化

Result: JUDGEBERT与人类判断的相关性优于现有指标，通过了两个关键合理性检查：相同句子得100%，无关句子得0%

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT有潜力改变法律NLP应用，确保法律文本简化对法律从业者和普通用户的准确性和可访问性

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DreamCUB框架，构建对话世界模型来预测用户情感、情绪、意图和未来话语，通过POMDP建模用户信念，并应用基于模型的强化学习提升对话系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在机器人、游戏和自动驾驶领域应用广泛，但在自然语言任务中的应用相对有限，特别是在对话系统中对用户心理状态的建模存在不足。

Method: 通过定义POMDP将情感、情绪和意图建模为用户信念，利用信息瓶颈最大化求解，并应用基于模型的强化学习框架DreamCUB，联合训练策略、评论家和对话世界模型。

Result: 预训练的对话世界模型在情感分类和情绪识别任务上达到最先进性能，对话质量通过联合训练得到提升，同时在探索-利用平衡和外域场景（如共情对话）中表现良好。

Conclusion: DreamCUB框架成功构建了对话世界模型，有效建模用户心理状态，提升了对话系统的性能和外域泛化能力，为自然语言处理中的世界模型应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

*Hyunjun Kim,Junwoo Ha,Sangyoon Yu,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBJEX(MT)基准测试评估LLM在多轮越狱对话中提取目标的能力，结果显示当前模型在目标推断上存在高置信度错误，建议提供明确目标和使用选择性预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM作为模型评判者时，在嘈杂、对抗性多轮越狱对话中推断潜在目标的能力可靠性

Method: 引入OBJEX(MT)基准，要求模型将对话转录提炼为单句基础目标并报告置信度，使用语义相似度评分，通过ECE、Brier分数等评估元认知

Result: claude-sonnet-4表现最佳（准确率0.515，校准最佳），gpt-4.1和Qwen3准确率0.441但过度自信，不同数据集性能差异显著（0.167-0.865）

Conclusion: LLM评判者在多轮越狱中经常高置信度错误推断目标，建议提供明确目标和使用选择性预测来管理风险

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了条件前门提示（CFD-Prompting）框架，通过构建反事实外部知识来消除LLMs内部偏见，实现查询与答案间因果效应的无偏估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG和CoT虽然能增强LLMs的外部知识利用，但仍受内部偏见影响导致错误答案，需要解决知识密集型任务中的深度推理问题

Method: 采用条件前门调整方法，构建反事实外部知识来模拟查询在不同上下文中的行为，解决了查询固定无法直接进行因果干预的挑战

Result: 在多个LLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CFD-Prompting在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 条件前门提示框架在较弱假设下运行，增强了推理过程的鲁棒性和泛化能力，有效解决了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的内部偏见问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了情感幻觉的概念，并开发了AHaBench基准测试和AHaPairs数据集来诊断和缓解大型语言模型在情感敏感交互中产生的虚假情感连接风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于情感敏感交互，其模拟的共情能力可能造成虚假的情感连接幻觉，存在心理安全风险。

Method: 构建了包含500个心理健康相关提示的AHaBench基准测试和5K实例的AHaPairs偏好数据集，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行模型对齐。

Result: DPO微调显著减少了情感幻觉，同时不损害核心推理和知识性能，人类-模型一致性分析证实了AHaBench的有效性。

Conclusion: 情感幻觉是一个独特的安全问题，该研究为开发既事实可靠又心理安全的大型语言模型提供了实用资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.
Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that
may be emotionally distressing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出KnowProb方法，通过知识引导的后验解释方式探测预训练语言模型是否理解文本背后的隐含知识，发现现有模型在捕捉隐藏知识方面仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然表现出强大的推理能力，但其黑盒特性带来的可信度问题日益凸显，需要开发解释性方法来探测模型对隐含知识的理解程度。

Method: 提出KnowProb知识引导探测方法，从文本底层内容中提取六种潜在解释（三种基于知识的理解和三种基于关联的推理），以多角度探测黑盒模型。

Result: 实验验证当前PLM仅学习单一表示分布，在捕捉文本隐藏知识方面存在显著挑战；KnowProb方法能有效从多角度识别现有黑盒模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于推动以可解释方式检测黑盒模型的研究，为提升模型可信度提供有效工具。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究从价值观设定和数据中心视角，对6个主流大语言模型的AI对齐实践进行审计分析，揭示了当前对齐过程中在价值选择和数据使用方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐（特别是RLHF）已成为LLM后训练阶段的核心技术，但除了计算技术外，缺乏对价值选择和数据收集等更广泛问题的关注。研究旨在从价值观设定和数据中心角度揭示对齐在实践中的应用情况。

Method: 调查审计5家领先组织发布的6个LLM开发项目的公开文档（包括OpenAI GPT、Anthropic Claude、Google Gemini等专有模型和Meta Llama等开源模型），重点关注过去3年发布的模型。

Result: 详细记录了每个项目的发现，并从价值观设定和数据中心角度提供了总体总结，揭示了对齐实践中的具体做法和局限性。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，讨论了一系列更广泛的相关关切，指出了当前AI对齐在价值植入和数据使用方面需要改进的问题。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

TL;DR: 通过前缀树索引和约束生成技术，让大语言模型能够直接访问外部知识库，避免依赖检索模型或复杂流程，提高回答的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型的知识空白和幻觉问题，传统RAG和工具调用方案存在流程复杂、错误传播、计算费用高等缺点。

Method: 使用知识图三元组语文化为文本事实，构建前缀树索引，通过约束生成技术让模型只生成存在于知识库中的序列。

Result: 方案能够扩展到大规模知识库（8亿条事实），适应领域特定数据，在问答任务上取得有效结果，且生成时间开销最小。

Conclusion: ReFactX提供了一种可扩展、高效的方法，让LLM能够直接访问外部知识而无需额外模型或服务，显著提升了回答的可靠性。

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GRADE评估框架，通过推理深度和语义距离两个维度来衡量RAG系统的多步推理能力，构建了难度可控的合成数据集进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估忽略了真实场景中的结构复杂性和多步推理需求，特别是检索难度与推理深度之间的交互关系。

Method: 从新闻文章提取知识图谱并通过语义聚类增强来构建合成多跳QA数据集，设计了结合生成端和检索端难度的2D难度矩阵。

Result: 跨多个领域和模型的实验显示错误率与难度度量强相关，验证了其诊断效用。

Conclusion: GRADE框架能够对RAG性能进行细粒度分析，为评估和改进现实应用中的多跳推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeAR是一个开源的双阶段文档重排序框架，通过分离细粒度相关性评分和整体文档分析任务，在多个基准测试中超越了现有开源方法和GPT-4


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文档重排序中虽然支持全局推理，但单一模型难以同时平衡细粒度相关性评分和跨文档整体分析

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段从冻结的13B LLaMA教师模型蒸馏token级相关性信号到紧凑的{3,8}B学生模型；第二阶段附加第二个LoRA适配器，在GPT-4o生成的思维链排列上进行微调

Result: 在TREC-DL19/20、八个BEIR数据集和NovelEval-2306上表现优异，DL20上nDCG@5提升+5.1，NovelEval上nDCG@10达到90.97，超越GPT-4 +3.09；在开放域QA中Top-1准确率达到54.29

Conclusion: DeAR通过双损失蒸馏确保稳定校准，为现代重排序系统提供了高效且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了KLQ方法，一种新的基于动作值的强化学习方法，用于语言模型的人类反馈强化学习，该方法在特定意义上等同于PPO，但在KL散度处理上更加理论严谨，并在实验中表现出与PPO相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO虽然经验上有效，但其启发式动机和对KL散度约束的临时处理方式缺乏理论依据，需要开发更理论严谨的方法。

Method: 提出了KL正则化Q学习（KLQ）方法，这是一种新的动作值强化学习方法，专门针对LM-RLHF设置设计，在特定意义上与PPO等价。

Result: KLQ在摘要和单轮对话两个关键语言生成任务上与PPO性能相当，在LLM作为评判的评估中 consistently 获得更高的胜率。

Conclusion: KLQ为LM-RLHF提供了一种理论更严谨的替代方法，在保持PPO性能优势的同时，提供了更好的理论基础和评估表现。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过充分利用LLM的长期规划能力，本文方法能够有效提升表格理解的性能，解决了现有方法在步骤联系和规划方面的不足。

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过实体导向接近和图查询技术，有效提升了表格理解的性能和上下文明确性，为该领域开启了新的研究方向

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks
WikiTableQuestions and TabFact.

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用约束LLM生成几何控制的示例；2) 通过多智能体反思过程进行增强，促进风格多样性并发现边缘案例

Result: 在两个基准数据集上证明，使用GRAID增强的有害文本分类数据集能显著提高下游护栏模型的性能

Conclusion: GRAID通过结合几何控制和反思增强，能够可靠覆盖输入空间并细致探索有害内容，有效解决数据稀缺问题

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

TL;DR: BridgeX-ICL是一种通过共享神经元来提升大语言模型在低资源语言上零样本跨语言学习性能的有效方法，利用双语词典构建神经元探针数据，并通过HSIC度量选择最优语言桥接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在低资源语言上性能提升面临挑战，需要无需昂贵微调的数据高效方法。从语言桥接的角度出发，探索共享神经元是否能改善跨语言性能。

Method: 基于MUSE双语词典构建神经元探针数据，定义语言重叠神经元子集确保完全激活，提出基于HSIC的度量来量化语言谱并指导最优桥接选择。

Result: 在2个跨语言任务和15个语言对（涵盖7个不同语系）上的实验验证了BridgeX-ICL的有效性，并为LLMs的多语言机制提供了实证见解。

Conclusion: BridgeX-ICL通过探索神经元共享机制，为提升低资源语言的跨语言学习性能提供了简单而有效的方法，揭示了LLMs内部的多语言工作机制。

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了转换器模型中的标记同质化现象，即标记表征在不同层中向均匀性收敛的趋势，以及其与位置偏置的关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型中标记表征的演化过程，特别是标记在处理过程中失去特异性的同质化现象，以及位置偏置如何强化这种效应。

Method: 通过层间相似性分析和受控实验，系统地考察标记表征在转换器各层中的变化过程，并分析位置偏置机制对同质化现象的影响。

Result: 实验结果证实了标记同质化现象的存在，标记在处理过程中系统性地失去特异性，尤其在偏向极端位置时这种效应更为显著。同时证明了同质化现象依赖于位置注意力机制。

Conclusion: 这项研究确认了转换器模型中存在标记同质化现象，并揭示了其与位置偏置机制的依赖关系，为理解大语言模型的内部运作机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 结合注意力机制和自然语言推理的混合方法，用于识别文档中句子间的语义关系（前提或矛盾）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在权衡：Transformer注意力机制能识别文本连接但缺乏语义标签，NLI模型能分类句子关系但缺乏上下文显著性。需要结合两者优势进行针对性分析

Method: 流水线方法：首先通过聚合token级注意力分数识别与目标句子上下文相关的候选句子，然后使用预训练NLI模型将每个候选分类为前提（蕴含）或矛盾，最后用注意力显著性分数过滤NLI识别的关系

Result: 该方法能有效隔离文本中任何给定主张的最重要语义关系

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法成功结合了注意力机制和NLI模型的优势，为句子关系识别提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

TL;DR: 标题框架对用户后续搜索行为有显著影响，冲突和策略框架会干扰查询一致性，而情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究搜索引擎中标题框架如何影响用户的信息搜索行为，虽然框架效应对判断的影响已有研究，但对后续搜索行为的影响尚不明确

Method: 通过控制实验，让参与者在特定语言框架过滤的标题中发出查询并进行选择

Result: 标题框架显著影响后续查询：冲突和策略框架破坏了与先前选择的一致性，情景框架比主题框架产生更具体的查询，观察到适度的短期框架持续性但随时间减弱

Conclusion: 即使是短暂的框架暴露也能显著改变用户信息寻求行为的方向

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习模型在识别同一语言的不同方言和口音时表现不稳定，无法将它们作为统一类别进行一致性分类。

Method: 提出给位置感知的语言识别方法，将语言级地理位置信息作为辅助任务引入模型，并将预测的向量注入中间表征中作为条件信号。

Result: 在六个多语言数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了对语言内变体和未见域的鲁棒性，在FLEURS数据集上达到新的独占鲜顶准确率97.7%，并在ML-SUPERB 2.0方言集上获得9.7%的相对收益。

Conclusion: 通过明确的条件控制，该方法能够促使模型学习到更统一的表征，有效解决了现有自监督学习模型在方言和口音识别中的一致性问题，为语言识别领域带来重要改进。

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

Result: 研究发现问题实例的计算复杂性类别和语法结构对模型学习推理规则有显著影响，且满足性问题的分布存在特定规律。

Conclusion: 这项研究为评估变换器语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的表现提供了更加准确的基准，并强调了考虑计算复杂性因素在模型评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言评估中存在的混杂因素（如目标语言、实验设置、模型选择）导致结果分散和混杂的问题，特别是对低资源语言的评估困难。

Method: 提出了一个框架，引入三个可解释的指标：性能实现比、其变异系数和语言潜力。通过对13个模型变体在11个多语言数据集上的案例研究进行验证。

Result: 证明了该框架能够提供更可靠的模型性能和语言差异测量，特别是对低资源语言。重要发现是更高的整体模型性能并不一定意味着跨语言的更大公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更有深度的多语言评估方法，能够更准确地评估模型在不同语言上的表现差异，并揭示了性能与公平性之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索大型语言模型在考虑预定义标注者角色下进行仇恨言论和侮辱性内容标注的能力，发现在弱数据视角主义下表现优于强视角主义和人类标注，但无法超越个性化强视角数据集的人类标注性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在数据视角主义框架下进行内容标注的能力，特别是考虑不同标注者角色特征时的表现，以评估LLM在主观标注任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用预定义的标注者角色（persona）来引导LLM进行仇恨言论和侮辱性内容标注，将LLM生成的标注与现有标注者建模技术进行比较，评估在不同数据视角主义强度下的表现。

Result: LLM会选择性使用角色中的 demographic 属性，识别出原型标注者；在弱数据视角主义下，不依赖标注者信息的建模技术表现优于强视角主义和人类标注；对于强视角个性化数据集，LLM性能接近但未超越人类标注者。

Conclusion: 尽管通过主观提示，LLM生成的视角倾向于聚合而非个性化；LLM在标注任务中展现潜力，但在强视角个性化场景下仍无法完全替代人类标注者。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

Conclusion: SSFO是第一个自监督的RAG忠实度对齐方法，无需标注成本或额外推理负担，通过理论分析和实证验证了其有效性，为RAG系统的忠实度优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动bundle生成中计算成本过高，而简单的知识蒸馏会导致不同类型知识之间的冲突，影响bundle生成性能

Method: 提出RouteDK框架：1）从教师LLM蒸馏两种互补知识（高层通用规则和细粒度会话推理）；2）为每种知识训练专门的LoRA专家；3）设计动态融合模块和输入感知路由器来平衡专家贡献；4）增加推理时增强模块提高可靠性

Conclusion: RouteDK通过有效路由不同类型的蒸馏知识，成功解决了知识冲突问题，为高效bundle生成提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

*Haojie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DropLoRA是一种基于剪枝的LoRA改进方法，通过在两个低秩矩阵之间插入剪枝模块来模拟动态子空间学习，克服传统LoRA静态子空间的限制，在不增加训练和推理成本的情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用低秩分解近似参数更新，但与全参数微调相比存在性能差距。低秩更新往往导致下游任务性能瓶颈，需要一种能够动态适应学习子空间的方法来突破这一限制。

Method: 在LoRA的两个低秩矩阵之间集成剪枝模块，专注于秩维度的剪枝，实现动态低秩子空间学习。这种方法模拟动态子空间学习，而不是试图克服低秩瓶颈。

Result: 在LLaMA系列模型的大规模语言模型生成任务中，包括常识推理、数学推理、代码生成和指令跟随等广泛任务上，DropLoRA始终优于传统LoRA方法。

Conclusion: DropLoRA通过动态低秩子空间学习有效克服了传统LoRA的静态子空间限制，在不增加额外成本的情况下显著提升了参数高效微调的性能，为大型语言模型的微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过构建日本行政法院判决的法律知识图谱，提出了能够准确捕捉法律推理结构的自动化方法，在相关法律条文检索方面超越了现有的大语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化法律推理方法常常无法准确识别相关法律上下文，不能准确追踪事实与法律规范的关联，并可能误表叹审判推理的层次结构，影响了捕捉法律实践中的应用情况。

Method: 从648份日本行政法院判决中构建法律知识图谱，使用提示基础的大语言模型提取法律推理组件，归一化法律条文引用，通过法律推理本体论将事实、规范和法律应用连接起来。

Result: 生成的图谱捕捉了真实法院判决中法律推理的完整结构，使隐式推理显式化并可机器读取。经专家注释数据评估，该系统在从事实检索相关法律条文方面超过了大语言模型基线和检索增强方法。

Conclusion: 通过构建法律知识图谱，该方法能够有效解决现有法律推理自动化方法的限制，为法律智能分析提供了更准确的结构化表达方式。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

*Sanad Shaban,Nizar Habash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出阿拉伯语通用性评分（AGS）作为阿拉伯语方言连续性的补充度量，通过词对齐、词源感知编辑距离和平滑技术来量化词汇在方言间的通用程度，优于现有方言识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语方言度（ALDi）将复杂的方言变异简化为单一维度，无法充分捕捉词汇在方言间的通用性分布，需要更细粒度的度量方法。

Method: 提出AGS评分系统，采用包含词对齐、词源感知编辑距离和平滑技术的流程来标注平行语料库，然后训练回归模型预测上下文中的AGS值。

Result: 该方法在多方言基准测试中优于强基线模型，包括最先进的方言识别系统，证明了AGS的有效性。

Conclusion: AGS提供了一种可扩展的、基于语言学的方法来建模词汇通用性，丰富了阿拉伯语方言度的表示，是对现有ALDi度量的重要补充。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

TL;DR: 对阿拉伯语大模型ALLaM-34B进行的扩展评估显示，该模型在生成任务、语码转换、现代标准阿拉伯语处理、推理能力和方言保真度方面表现优异，安全性能稳定，证明了其作为强大阿拉伯语LLM的实际部署准备度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主要基于英语语料训练的大语言模型在捕捉阿拉伯语语言和文化细微差别方面的不足，评估专门针对阿拉伯语优化的ALLaM-34B模型的性能表现。

Method: 使用包含现代标准阿拉伯语、五种地区方言、语码转换、事实知识、算术和时序推理、创意生成以及对抗性安全性的提示包，收集115个输出样本，由三个前沿LLM评委（GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Sonnet-4）进行评分，计算类别级别均值并分析分数分布。

Result: 生成和语码转换任务平均得分4.92/5，现代标准阿拉伯语处理4.74/5，推理能力4.64/5，方言保真度4.21/5，安全相关提示稳定性能4.54/5，整体表现优异。

Conclusion: ALLaM-34B被证明是一个强大且文化根基深厚的阿拉伯语大语言模型，展示了技术实力和实际部署的现实准备度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATA是一个自动化测试LLM代理的元代理系统，通过代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和对抗测试生成，结合LLM评分来发现代理的弱点，比人工测试更高效且能发现更多严重错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理评估主要依赖静态基准测试和小规模人工研究，缺乏自动化、全面的测试方法，需要一种能够自适应生成测试用例并发现代理弱点的系统

Method: 结合静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘和基于角色的对抗测试生成，通过LLM作为评分员来评估对话质量并指导后续测试方向，难度根据评分反馈自适应调整

Result: 在旅行规划器和维基百科写作器上，ATA在20-30分钟内发现比专家标注更多样化和严重的错误，匹配严重性水平，而十人标注团队需要数天时间

Conclusion: ATA提供了一种高效、自动化的LLM代理测试方法，能够输出量化指标和定性错误报告，代码分析和网络搜索对减少方差和校准错误至关重要，该方法已开源供复现使用

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

TL;DR: DashboardQA是首个专门评估视觉语言GUI代理理解交互式仪表板能力的基准，包含112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对，测试结果显示当前最先进的代理在此任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据可视化问答基准主要关注静态图表，忽视了交互式仪表板的重要性，无法有效评估现代多模态GUI代理的能力。

Method: 创建DashboardQA基准，包含来自Tableau Public的112个交互式仪表板和405个涵盖多种问题类型的问答对，用于评估各种GUI代理的性能。

Result: 评估显示所有视觉语言模型在交互式仪表板推理方面都存在显著挑战，最佳代理（基于Gemini-Pro-2.5）准确率仅为38.69%，OpenAI CUA代理仅为22.69%。

Conclusion: 交互式仪表板推理是一个极具挑战性的任务，当前GUI代理在基础元素识别、交互轨迹规划和推理能力方面存在明显不足，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的检索优先、LLM支持的声明规范化方法，在CheckThat! 2025 Task 2中，该方法在13种语言的单语设置中7种排名第一，但在零样本设置中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声明规范化是自动事实核查系统的关键组成部分，需要将嘈杂的社交媒体帖子等数据解析为规范化声明，以供后续真实性分类任务使用。

Method: 采用检索优先、LLM支持的轻量级流水线：动态提示GPT-4o-mini并提供上下文示例，或直接从训练数据集中检索最接近的规范化结果。

Result: 在官方测试集上，该系统在大多数单语赛道中排名靠前，在13种语言中的7种获得第一名。但在零样本设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案在单语环境下效果显著，但在跨语言零样本场景中存在局限性，需要进一步改进以适应更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

Motivation: 印度语言在自然语言处理中面临复杂形态变化、多样文字系统和标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是马拉地语等低资源语言缺乏高质量的释义数据集。

Method: 构建了由人类专家标注的高质量马拉地语释义语料库，包含8000个句子对（释义和非释义），并采用基于BERT的transformer模型进行基准测试。

Result: 创建了L3Cube-MahaParaphrase数据集，提供了标准BERT模型在该数据集上的性能结果，为马拉地语NLP研究提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了马拉地语释义数据集的空白，为低资源印度语言的NLP任务提供了有价值的资源和基准模型，数据集和模型已公开共享。

Abstract: Paraphrases are a vital tool to assist language understanding tasks such as
question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation
tasks. Indic languages are complex in natural language processing (NLP) due to
their rich morphological and syntactic variations, diverse scripts, and limited
availability of annotated data. In this work, we present the
L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset, a high-quality paraphrase corpus for Marathi, a
low resource Indic language, consisting of 8,000 sentence pairs, each annotated
by human experts as either Paraphrase (P) or Non-paraphrase (NP). We also

Motivation: 大型语言模型在说服性对话中难以平衡对错误信息的轻信和对有效纠正的抵抗，这对可靠部署构成关键挑战

Method: 引入DuET-PD双评估框架，从说服类型（纠正性/误导性）和领域（知识/安全）两个维度评估多轮立场变化动态；提出Holistic DPO训练方法，平衡正负说服示例

Result: GPT-4o在持续误导性说服下MMLU-Pro准确率仅27.32%；新开源模型呈现谄媚性增强趋势；Holistic DPO将Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在安全上下文误导性说服下的准确率从4.21%提升至76.54%

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更可靠和适应性的多轮对话LLM提供了有效途径，DuET-PD框架和Holistic DPO方法能同时增强对错误信息的鲁棒性和对纠正的接受度

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究分析了动词多词表达式(VMWE)对机器翻译质量的负面影响，并提出基于大语言模型的重写方法来改善翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动词多词表达式具有复杂和非组合性质，对自然语言处理构成重大挑战，虽然机器翻译模型在近年取得显著进步，但准确翻译这些复杂语言结构仍是一个未解决的问题

Method: 分析三类VMWE（动词习语、动词-粒子结构、轻动词结构）对英语到多语种翻译质量的影响，使用现有多词表达式数据集和从翻译数据集提取的包含这些语言现象的句子，评估最先进翻译系统的处理能力，并提出基于LLM的重写方法

Result: 实验结果一致显示VMWE对翻译质量产生负面影响，重写方法在动词习语和动词-粒子结构的翻译中展示出显著的质量改善

Conclusion: 动词多词表达式是机器翻译的重要挑战，基于大语言模型的重写策略能够有效提升对这些复杂语言现象的翻译质量

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

TL;DR: 提出基于句子排序的零样本文档分类方法，通过TF-IDF选择最信息丰富的句子，在保持分类准确性的同时减少35%推理时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型如BERT擅长短文本分类但受限于输入长度和计算效率，难以处理长文档分类问题

Method: 使用TF-IDF句子排序策略选择文档中最具信息量的句子，无需改变模型架构即可适配短文本训练的模型到长文档

Result: 在MahaNews数据集上，仅保留前50%排名句子即可保持与完整文档相当的分类性能，同时推理时间减少35%

Conclusion: 句子排序是一种简单有效的技术，可实现可扩展且高效的零样本文档分类

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端的法语SSML标签插入管道，通过两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型实现韵律控制，显著提升了合成语音的自然度和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业文本转语音系统在韵律控制方面存在局限，导致合成语音缺乏表现力，需要更好的方法来控制音高、语速、音量和停顿持续时间。

Method: 采用级联架构，使用两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型：一个预测短语断点位置，另一个对韵律目标进行回归，生成商业TTS兼容的SSML标记。

Result: 在14小时法语播客语料上，断点放置F1达到99.2%，音高、语速和音量的平均绝对误差比仅使用提示的LLM和BiLSTM基线降低25-40%。感知评估中平均意见分从3.20提升到3.87，18名听众中有15人偏好增强合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在缩小合成法语语音与自然语音之间的表现力差距方面取得了实质性进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多智能体辩论(MAD)的性能提升主要来自多数投票机制，而非辩论过程本身。理论分析表明辩论本身不能提高期望正确率，但通过有针对性的干预可以增强辩论效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体辩论(MAD)在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但其有效性的关键驱动因素尚不清楚。本研究旨在解构MAD，分析多数投票和智能体间辩论各自的作用。

Method: 通过七个NLP基准测试的广泛实验，将MAD分解为多数投票和智能体间辩论两个组件。提出理论框架将辩论建模为随机过程，证明其诱导信念轨迹的鞅性质。

Result: 实验发现多数投票单独贡献了MAD大部分性能提升。理论证明辩论本身不会提高期望正确率。通过有针对性的干预可以显著增强辩论效果。

Conclusion: 虽然MAD有潜力，但在许多实际场景中，简单的集成方法仍然是更强大和可靠的选择。研究强调了理解辩论机制本质的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

TL;DR: 本文提出将LLM拟人化视为设计概念，而非风险问题，建立了包含感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度的分类体系，为实践者提供可操作的设计杠杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究过度关注拟人化的风险（如过度信任和用户欺骗），缺乏设计指导。作者认为拟人化应作为可调节的设计概念来支持用户目标。

Method: 从多学科角度提出拟人化设计框架，将线索分为感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度，分析每个线索的表现形式和有效性。

Result: 建立了统一的分类体系，为从业者提供了可操作的设计杠杆，并倡导基于功能的拟人化设计评估方法。

Conclusion: 拟人化应被视为设计者与解释者之间的交互过程，通过精心设计的线索来优化人机交互体验，而非单纯的风险问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CausalSent框架，通过双头RieszNet神经网络架构改进文本分类器的因果效应估计，在IMDB影评数据上实现了比现有方法更好的处理效应估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代NLP模型性能优异，但其决策过程仍是一个黑箱。因果NLP领域旨在结合因果推断理论和NLP模型来阐明文本特征的因果效应，提高模型可解释性。

Method: 开发了基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构，使用经过验证的模型集成进行观察性案例研究，在半合成的IMDB电影评论数据上评估处理效应。

Result: 在IMDB影评数据上，CausalSent将效应估计的MAE降低了2-3倍；案例研究发现"love"一词的存在导致正面情感概率增加2.9%。

Conclusion: CausalSent框架能够更准确地估计文本特征的因果效应，为理解NLP模型决策提供了有效的因果解释工具。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

TL;DR: UQ是一个基于未解决问题的AI基准测试平台，通过异步评估和社区验证来测试前沿模型在真实世界挑战性问题的表现


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有基准测试中难度与真实性的矛盾：考试式基准往往人为制造难度而缺乏实际价值，基于真实用户交互的基准又偏向简单高频问题

Method: 构建包含500个Stack Exchange未解决问题的数据集，结合规则过滤、LLM判断和人工审核确保问题质量；使用复合验证策略利用生成器-验证器差距提供评估信号；建立开放平台让专家集体验证问题和解决方案

Result: 顶级模型仅通过15%问题的UQ验证，初步人工验证已在通过的问题中识别出正确答案

Conclusion: UQ为评估前沿模型在真实世界开放性挑战中的表现开辟了新路径，成功解决这些问题将推动人类知识前沿

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型剪枝对LLM生成意见摘要公平性的影响，特别是在可能影响公众观点的偏见输出方面，这一领域尚未被研究。

Method: 使用三种最先进的剪枝方法和多种校准集，对三个开源LLM进行系统性分析，提出High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)剪枝方法，识别并移除对输入处理冗余但对输出生成有影响的参数。

Result: 剪枝方法对公平性的影响比校准集更大，HGLA方法相比现有方法能更好地保持甚至提高公平性，人类评估显示HGLA生成的输出更公平。

Conclusion: HGLA剪枝方法在保持模型性能的同时，能够有效维护LLM生成摘要的公平性，在传统方法存在局限性的模型和任务中表现出良好前景。

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了FASB框架，通过动态跟踪LLM内部状态来决定干预的必要性和强度，并引入回溯机制来纠正偏离的token，在TruthfulQA和多个选择题数据集上表现优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法要么对所有生成内容进行无差别干预，要么仅依赖问题来决定干预，无法准确评估干预强度，且检测到偏离后干预往往为时已晚

Method: FASB框架动态跟踪LLM生成过程中的内部状态，同时考虑问题和已生成内容来决定干预的必要性和强度，并采用回溯机制纠正已偏离的token

Result: 在TruthfulQA数据集和六个多选数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于基线方法

Conclusion: FASB框架通过动态干预决策和回溯机制，有效提升了LLM行为对齐的效果，是一种高效且成本低廉的激活引导方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Motivation: 当前人机交互中情感语音的重要性日益凸显，但缺乏全面的情感推理评估系统，需要解决情感语音数据稀缺和情感连贯性评估的问题。

Method: 使用文本转语音技术生成多样化情感状态的数据集，提出跨轮情感推理评分(CERS)来评估多轮对话中的情感转换，采用连续、分类和感知三种指标评估七个对话系统。

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂思维任务中存在过度思考问题，这会导致性能下降和资源浪费，需要找到一种高效准确的方法来识别思维完成时机。

Method: 将思维过程分为三个阶段，重点识别补偿性思维阶段结束的关键点（RCP）。通过挖掘敏感且一致的RCP模式，开发了基于含义规则的轻量级阈值策略来准确检测RCP。

Result: 在AIME24、AIME25、GPQA-D等标准测试集上，该方法在保持或提升思维准确性的同时，显著减少了令牌消耗量。

Conclusion: 通过识别思维完成点来避免过度思考，是一种高效且实用的方法，能够在节省计算资源的同时维持思维能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: DPO在大型语言模型对齐中存在奖励攻击问题，导致生成内容过长缺乏多样性以及灾难性遗忘，这是由于参数空间中的神经元崩溃导致的表示冗余

Method: 提出权重旋转偏好优化(RoPO)算法，在DPO的KL散度约束基础上，通过多粒度正交矩阵对中间隐藏状态进行显式约束，防止策略模型偏离参考模型太远

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上提升3.27分，在MT-Bench上以仅0.015%的可训练参数超越最佳基线6.2-7.5分

Conclusion: RoPO有效缓解了DPO的奖励攻击问题，保持了预训练和SFT阶段获得的知识和表达能力

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

Method: 构建包含4200+人工撰写综述的SurveyGen数据集，开发QUAL-SG质量感知框架，在RAG流程中融入质量指标来选择高质量源文献

Result: 实验和人工评估显示半自动流程可达到部分竞争力，但完全自动生成仍存在引用质量低和批判性分析有限的问题

Conclusion: 虽然半自动方法有潜力，但完全自动化的文献综述生成在质量和批判性分析方面仍需改进，需要更多人类参与

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

TL;DR: CoCoA是一种新颖的自适应解码算法，通过置信度感知测量和参数化-上下文分布间的广义散度来解决LLM中的知识冲突问题，在保持低冲突场景性能的同时显著提升问答准确性和事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在参数化记忆与外部上下文之间存在知识冲突时，现有对比解码方法缺乏适应性且在低冲突场景下性能下降，需要一种更有效的冲突解决方法来提高生成忠实度。

Method: 提出CoCoA算法，利用熵差和上下文峰值度等置信度感知测量，以及参数化分布与上下文分布之间的广义散度，在token级别进行自适应的冲突解决。

Result: 在多个QA、摘要和长问答基准测试中，CoCoA相比强基线AdaCAD平均提升QA准确率9.2个百分点，摘要和长问答的事实性平均提升2.5个百分点，并展现出对冲突变化的优异敏感性。

Conclusion: CoCoA能够实现更知情、上下文感知且最终更忠实的token生成，为LLM中的知识冲突问题提供了有效的自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately

TL;DR: 提出了TextTopoOOD框架和TNT-OOD方法，用于解决文本丰富网络中复杂的OOD检测问题，通过融合文本和拓扑结构特征来提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理标签偏移或简单域划分，忽略了文本-结构多样性，如社交网络中机器人和正常用户的语言模式差异

Method: 1) TextTopoOOD评估框架包含四种OOD场景；2) TNT-OOD方法使用交叉注意力模块融合局部结构到文本表示，以及超网络生成节点特定变换参数

Result: 在11个数据集和四种OOD场景上的实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TextTopoOOD框架揭示了文本丰富网络中OOD检测的细微挑战，TNT-OOD方法通过融合文本和拓扑特征显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Transformer中前馈网络(FFN)在不同层的重要性分布，特别是在预训练过程中的作用，而非使用现成预训练模型

Method: 提出实验方法：保持总参数量不变，增加某些层的FFN维度，完全移除其他层的FFN；从头训练不同规模(285M/570M/1.2B)和层数(12/24/40)的模型

Result: 将FFN集中在70%的连续中间层的配置在多个下游任务上持续优于标准配置

Conclusion: FFN在Transformer中间层具有最重要的作用，优化FFN层分布可以提升模型性能

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

Motivation: 确保LLM在表格分类等下游任务输出中的公平性对于包容性、平等表示和负责任AI部署至关重要，传统静态验证方法存在局限性。

Method: 引入动态验证集概念，随测试集同步演化；提出SMITE迭代算法选择最优上下文示例，每个示例集都通过对应的动态验证集进行验证，选择总误差最低的示例集作为最终演示集。

Result: 在四种不同LLM上的实验表明，所提技术相比基线方法显著提高了预测准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: 这是首个在LLM上下文学习中应用动态验证的研究，为提升LLM性能和公平性提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在训练过程中可能无意中暴露受版权保护或专有数据，传统方法只能在内容生成后处理，存在敏感信息泄露风险

Method: 使用精选的版权材料数据集训练神经网络分类器，在文本生成前分析LLM内部状态来识别潜在泄露风险，并与RAG系统集成实现早期干预

Result: 分析内部状态的方法能有效降低版权数据泄漏风险，提供可扩展的解决方案，确保符合版权法规的同时保持高质量的文本生成

Conclusion: 该方法为AI工作流程提供了主动的版权保护机制，增强了数据隐私和伦理标准，实现代码已在GitHub开源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on
GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现GPT等大语言模型词汇表中存在大量表示中文色情和赌博内容的词汇，需要系统性地识别这些污染词汇并研究其与训练数据的关系

Method: 1) 基于GPT词汇表定义污染中文词汇分类 2) 微调LLM构建污染词汇检测器，结合语义和搜索引擎内容 3) 通过词汇出现情况推测训练数据污染程度

Result: 在GPT等23个LLM中发现污染词汇广泛存在，GPT表现最差：超过23%的长中文词汇涉及色情或赌博内容。验证了在C4和Pile数据集上的推测准确性，推测GPT-4o训练数据中约0.5%与"Yui Hatano"相关

Conclusion: 大语言模型词汇表中存在显著的中文污染词汇问题，反映了训练数据污染情况，需要更严格的数据清洗和过滤机制

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

Motivation: 解决上下文ASR系统中OOV词识别挑战，包括训练数据有限、发音模糊或不一致等问题。

Method: 利用TTS系统合成包含目标稀有词的多样化语音样本，使用预训练Whisper模型提取多种预测发音变体，构建前缀trie并在beam-search解码时进行浅层融合奖励。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上，偏置词错误率在test-clean上降低42%，test-other上降低43%，同时保持非偏置词错误率基本不变。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀有词识别问题，通过合成驱动的方式实现了零样本上下文ASR，显著提升了偏置词识别性能。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

Motivation: 推理大语言模型存在过度思考问题，即使简单问题也产生冗长推理链，导致计算效率低下。但批量处理时模型会动态压缩简单问题的推理步骤

Method: 提出动态推理配额分配(DRQA)方法，利用批量生成的偏好数据和强化学习，训练模型自适应分配推理资源，鼓励模型生成既准确又简洁的响应

Result: 在广泛数学和科学推理基准测试中，DRQA显著减少token使用量，同时保持甚至提高答案准确性

Conclusion: DRQA有效缓解过度思考问题，为推理大语言模型的高效可扩展部署提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

TL;DR: ILRe是一种新颖的上下文压缩管道，通过确定中间解码器层、流式分块预填充和基于注意力分数的令牌召回，将长上下文处理的复杂度从O(L²)降低到O(L)，在保持性能的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长上下文场景中的局限性，包括有效上下文长度短、二次计算复杂度和处理长输入时的高内存开销。

Method: 提出中间层检索(ILRe)管道：离线确定中间解码器层，通过流式分块预填充编码上下文，基于输入查询与完整键缓存的注意力分数召回令牌，并采用多池化核分配策略保持语义完整性。

Result: 在Huawei Ascend 910B NPU上，ILRe可在不到半分钟内处理100万令牌的请求（加速约180倍），在Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct模型上获得RULER-1M基准约79.8分。

Conclusion: ILRe无需额外后训练或算子开发，即可在长上下文场景中实现与完整上下文相当或更好的性能，同时大幅降低计算复杂度和处理时间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Conclusion: Pandora框架通过代码表示和知识迁移实现了强大的统一推理能力，为结构化知识推理提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Method: 分析多语言信息可用性的需求，并研究互联网上多语言相关的各种技术约束

Result: 尽管已有一些解决方案，但在消除语言障碍方面仍存在巨大差距需要填补

Conclusion: 随着越来越多非英语用户接入互联网，解决多语言信息获取的技术挑战变得日益重要

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

Motivation: 先前工作主要依赖语言外部信息识别借词，这可能引入循环性和限制到历史语言学工作流程中。

Method: 通过提取相关语言学特征、评分和概率映射，迭代精化初始结果，识别和泛化新兴模式直至收敛，结合语言学和统计线索的混合方法。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用语言内部信息就能有效检测借词，在跨语言环境下表现出色，为历史语言学提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何利用单个大语言模型执行多个论证挖掘任务，构建了统一格式的多任务数据集，并比较了三种微调策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证挖掘旨在从自然语言文本中自动提取论证结构及其关系，但现有研究多针对单一任务。本文探索如何利用单个大语言模型处理多个相关任务，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 1) 构建多任务数据集：将19个知名论证挖掘数据集转换为统一格式；2) 使用Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型探索三种训练策略：单任务微调、多任务联合微调和模型合并。

Result: 单任务微调在所有任务上显著提升性能；多任务微调保持强大性能且无退化，表明相关任务间存在有效迁移学习；模型合并提供了性能与计算成本的折中方案。

Conclusion: 单个大语言模型可以通过适当的微调策略有效处理多个论证挖掘任务，多任务学习和模型合并都是可行的解决方案，为相关NLP任务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

*Qiwei Peng,Guimin Hu,Yekun Chai,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在联合潜在空间而非直接在LLM表示上进行去偏，使用基于平行语料训练的自动编码器构建跨语言对齐潜在空间，显著提升去偏效果和跨语言迁移能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法（如SentDebias）直接应用于LLM表示时跨语言迁移效果有限，需要更好的跨语言去偏解决方案

Method: 使用基于平行TED演讲脚本训练的自动编码器构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间应用去偏技术

Result: 实验表明：1）自动编码器能有效构建对齐的跨语言潜在空间；2）在学习的跨语言潜在空间应用去偏技术显著提升整体去偏性能和跨语言迁移能力

Conclusion: 在联合潜在空间进行去偏比直接在LLM表示上操作更有效，为跨语言去偏提供了新思路

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实验探究大语言模型如何组合子词信息，分析了结构相似性、语义可分解性和形式保留三个关键方面，发现不同LLM家族在组合策略上存在三类明显差异模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何有效地将子词表示组合成有意义的词级表示，理解不同LLM在子词信息编码和整合方面的组合动态特性。

Method: 设计了一套全面的实验来探测LLM的子词组合方式，重点关注结构相似性、语义可分解性和形式保留三个维度，通过逐层分析来观察不同模型家族的表现模式。

Result: 发现五个LLM家族可分为三个明显不同的组别：(i)在结构相似性演化方面观察到三种不同模式；(ii)在语义可分解性敏感性方面表现出色；(iii)在形式特征敏感性方面也呈现三种不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对LLM组合动态的宝贵见解，揭示了不同LLM在编码和整合子词信息时的不同组合模式，反映了它们底层组合策略的差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

*Khaoula Chehbouni,Mohammed Haddou,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑大语言模型作为评估者(LLJs)的可靠性，认为当前对其热情可能为时过早，需要更严格的验证和负责任的使用实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在自然语言生成评估中的广泛应用，其有效性和可靠性尚未得到充分验证，需要基于测量理论进行批判性分析。

Method: 基于社会科学中的测量理论，分析LLJs作为评估工具的四个核心假设：人类判断代理能力、评估能力、可扩展性和成本效益，并通过文本摘要、数据标注和安全对齐三个应用场景进行验证。

Result: 发现LLJs的采用速度超过了对其可靠性的严格审查，存在固有局限性，当前实践可能无法充分验证其评估有效性。

Conclusion: 需要建立更负责任的LLJs评估实践，确保其在自然语言生成领域的发展中起到支持而非阻碍作用。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

TL;DR: 量化对模型偏见的影响评估：可能降低毒性但略微增加刻板印象和不公平性，特别是在高压缩率下


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全面评估量化技术如何影响模型偏见，特别是对不同人口统计子群体的影响，为实际应用中的效率与伦理平衡提供指导

Method: 使用权重和激活量化策略，在9个基准测试中采用概率性和生成文本指标，评估不同架构家族和推理能力的模型

Result: 量化对偏见的影响复杂：能降低模型毒性且不影响情感，但会略微增加刻板印象和生成任务中的不公平性，特别是在激进压缩下

Conclusion: 量化实践中需要仔细平衡效率与伦理考虑，趋势在不同人口统计类别和模型类型中基本一致，但具体程度取决于特定设置

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症常与多发性硬化症等神经退行性疾病共存，但基于语音的人工智能在这些情境下检测抑郁的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型，结合：1）传统语音和语言特征；2）语音情感识别模型提取的情感维度；3）探索性语音特征分析，进行跨语料库（英语普通人群和德语多发性硬化症患者）的交叉验证。

Result: 模型在多发性硬化症患者中检测抑郁情绪达到66%的未加权平均召回率，特征选择后提升至74%，表明情感变化在抑郁检测中具有重要作用。

Conclusion: 这项研究为在存在共病条件（如神经退行性疾病）的情况下推广基于语音的抑郁检测提供了初步探索，证明了该方法在跨人群和跨语言环境中的可行性。

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究长上下文LLM在工业领域技术问答任务中的实际表现，特别是在多语言信息检索场景下的能力，测试模型在"大海捞针"挑战和幻觉检测方面的性能。

Method: 基于农业机械用户手册构建多语言基准测试（英法德三语），采用直接提示与三种RAG策略（关键词、语义、混合）对比，使用LLM作为评判员进行评估。

Result: 混合RAG方法在所有语言版本中一致优于直接长上下文提示，部分模型在多语言环境下达到85%以上的高准确率，展示了RAG在专业工业领域的优势。

Conclusion: 在专业工业领域的多语言技术问答中，RAG方法比单纯依赖长上下文更有效，为类似评估提供了开放框架，并揭示了实际应用中的权衡和挑战。

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical
trade-offs and challenges.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了检测LLM规划行为的因果标准和方法，发现在不同模型和任务中规划行为存在差异，指令微调会优化而非创建规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设固定的规划视野且集中在单一领域，需要区分LLM的规划与即兴生成行为，建立可复现的检测方法。

Method: 提出形式化和因果基础的规划检测标准，开发半自动化标注流程，应用于Gemma-2-2B模型在代码生成和诗歌生成任务上的分析。

Result: 发现规划行为并非普遍存在：Gemma-2-2B在诗歌生成中采用即兴方式，在代码生成中混合使用规划和即兴策略，指令微调优化而非创建规划能力。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM规划机制的机理研究提供了可复现和可扩展的基础，揭示了不同模型和任务中规划行为的多样性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体上多模态内容的日益普及，情感分析在处理异构数据和识别多标签情感方面面临重大挑战。现有方法往往缺乏有效的跨模态融合和外部知识整合。

Method: 提出SentiMM多智能体框架：通过专门代理处理文本和视觉输入，融合多模态特征，通过知识检索丰富上下文，并聚合结果进行最终情感分类。同时引入了SentiMMD大规模多模态数据集，包含七个细粒度情感类别。

Conclusion: SentiMM框架通过系统化的多智能体设计和知识整合，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media,
sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing
heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often
lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We
propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically
address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through
specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge
retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our structured approach.

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in
Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the
quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts
remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of
studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the
cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the
localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required
to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We
further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes
from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: S²Sent提出了一种句子表示选择机制，通过空间选择和嵌套频率选择来优化Transformer编码器中不同块的表示融合，在保持低冗余和低语义损失的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer编码器和对比学习的主流句子表示学习方法通常只使用最后一层的隐藏状态，但不同Transformer块具有不同的语义感知能力，需要合理的跨块表示融合来优化性能。

Method: 提出S²Sent机制，在Transformer编码器下游集成参数化嵌套选择器，包含空间选择(SS)和嵌套频率选择(FS)。SS使用基于空间压缩的自门控机制获得自适应权重，FS使用不同DCT基函数替代GAP实现低语义损失的空间压缩。

Result: 大量实验表明，S²Sent在基线方法基础上取得显著改进，仅增加可忽略的额外参数和推理延迟，同时具有高集成性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: S²Sent通过合理的跨块表示融合机制，有效平衡了语义冗余和损失，为句子表示学习提供了有效的优化方向。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了DiscussLLM框架，通过训练模型主动决定何时发言来弥补LLMs在对话中的被动性，使用两阶段数据生成管道创建大规模标注数据集，训练模型在需要时保持沉默并在适当时机进行干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要作为被动响应代理，只在被提示时回应，这种被动性造成了"意识差距"，限制了它们作为动态人类讨论中真正协作伙伴的潜力。

Method: 开发了可扩展的两阶段数据生成管道，合成大规模多轮人类讨论数据集，标注五种干预类型和明确的对话触发点。训练模型预测特殊沉默标记来学习保持沉默直到需要做出有益贡献。探索了端到端模型和解耦分类器-生成器系统两种架构。

Conclusion: DiscussLLM框架成功解决了LLMs的被动性问题，通过训练模型主动决定发言时机，实现了更加协作和动态的对话体验，为未来对话AI的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

Motivation: 传统RAG模型端到端优化面临离散隐变量边缘化的挑战，现有方法如top-K边缘化和变分RAG存在梯度估计偏差或高方差问题。

Method: 提出基于联合随机逼近(JSA)算法的端到端RAG训练方法JSA-RAG，这是EM算法的随机扩展，特别适用于离散隐变量模型估计。

Result: 在5个数据集上的两个任务（开放域问答、知识对话）实验表明，JSA-RAG显著优于vanilla RAG和VRAG，在生成、检索和低方差梯度估计方面表现出色。

Conclusion: JSA-RAG为RAG模型的端到端优化提供了有效的解决方案，通过随机逼近算法成功解决了离散隐变量边缘化带来的梯度估计问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance

TL;DR: AulSign是一种利用大型语言模型进行手语翻译的新方法，通过动态提示和上下文学习解决数据稀缺问题，在低数据场景下优于现有最先进模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语翻译面临数据稀缺挑战，现有平行语料库有限且缺乏标准化，难以捕捉手语的完整语言丰富性，需要开发在数据稀缺环境下泛化能力强的翻译系统

Method: 利用大型语言模型通过动态提示和上下文学习，结合样本选择和后续手语关联，将手语与自然语言紧凑描述相关联来指导模型进行翻译

Result: 在英语和意大利语的SignBank+基准测试以及意大利LaCAM CNR-ISTC数据集上表现出色，在低数据场景下性能优于最先进模型

Conclusion: AulSign方法有效提升了手语翻译性能，有潜力增强 underrepresented 语言社区在通信技术中的可访问性和包容性

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

TL;DR: 通过语言分析识别个人音乐偏好，基于大五人格特质作为中介


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐偏好与个人身份密切相关，而人格特质可通过语言分析检测，研究尝试连接这两个领域

Method: 使用500,000+文本样本和5,000作者的数据集，建立高级模型分析音乐偏好者的人格特征

Result: 发现不同音乐流派粉丝在大五人格特质上存在显著差异

Conclusion: 证明了通过语言分析识别音乐偏好的可行性，为计算语言学、音乐心理学和人格分析的交叉研究提供了资源

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

*Rishikesh Devanathan,Varun Nathan,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于客服中心对话的合成转录生成方法，利用意图摘要、话题流程等监督信号指导生成，并建立了包含18个指标的诊断框架来评估合成对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客服中心对话具有目标导向、角色不对称和行为复杂等特点，且面临隐私和数据稀缺问题，需要开发专门的合成对话生成方法来支持模型训练和评估。

Method: 利用客服中心现有的意图摘要、话题流程等监督信号指导生成，提出了四种语言无关的生成策略（从简单提示到多阶段方法），并建立了18个基于语言和行为的诊断指标评估框架。

Result: 结果显示所有方法都存在挑战，没有一种方法在所有特征上都表现优异，特别是在不流畅性、情感和行为真实性方面存在明显缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的诊断工具能够暴露合成对话的差距，支持跨语言的细粒度评估和压力测试，为客服中心合成对话生成提供了有效的评估方法。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

*Meiling Ning,Zhongbao Zhang,Junda Ye,Jiabao Guo,Qingyuan Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ESFP-RM奖励模型框架，通过将AI反馈强化学习中的奖励建模重新定义为自然语言推理任务，利用带上下文解释的掩码语言模型提升奖励信号的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成式奖励模型的RLAIF方法虽然高效可扩展，但缺乏对奖励建模与自然语言推理任务形式一致性的认识，限制了模型理解边界的扩展。

Method: 提出两阶段ESFP-RM框架：首先使用包含上下文解释的掩码语言模型进行槽位预测，充分利用MLMs在自然语言推理任务上的优势；然后将该框架应用于奖励建模。

Result: 在RLHF和OOD场景下的广泛实验表明，ESFP-RM相比生成式奖励模型能提供更稳定和可泛化的奖励信号，且在NLI任务上显著优于主流自回归模型。

Conclusion: 将奖励建模重新定义为自然语言推理任务，并通过掩码语言模型结合上下文解释的框架，能够有效提升奖励模型的理解边界和性能表现。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话评测基准，包含语义、副语言和环境音三个维度，采用竞技场式和评分式双评测方法，发现当前语音大模型在副语言和环境音处理方面存在不足，评测方法在性能差距大时可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音大模型的评测框架不足以评估复杂多轮对话性能，需要更全面的评测基准。

Method: 构建MTalk-Bench多轮语音对话基准，涵盖三个核心维度（语义信息、副语言信息、环境音），每个维度包含9个现实场景，采用竞技场式对比评测和评分式绝对评测双方法。

Result: 语音大模型擅长语义处理但在副语言和环境音感知方面表现不佳；模型通过增加回复长度来恢复连贯性但牺牲效率；模态感知的任务特定设计优于简单扩展规模；评测方法在性能差距大时一致可靠。

Conclusion: 当前S2S评测存在局限性，需要更鲁棒、语音感知的评测框架，LLM作为评委在差距明显或标准明确时与人类一致，但存在位置和长度偏差。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

*Judith Tavarez-Rodríguez,Fernando Sánchez-Vega,A. Pastor López-Monroy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索不同大语言模型在社交媒体文本中检测性别歧视的能力，使用EXIST 2024数据集评估模型能否模拟不同人口群体的感知，并分析模型的统计偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自动检测性别歧视方面显示出潜力，但这些模型存在偏见，不能准确反映现实，特别是对少数群体的偏见。性别歧视检测任务因其主观性和自动化模型中的偏见而仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用EXIST 2024推文数据集，该数据集包含每条推文的六个不同人口统计特征的标注，评估不同LLMs检测性别歧视的能力，并进行统计分析和人口统计偏见分析。

Result: LLMs在一定程度上能够检测性别歧视，但无法准确复制不同人口群体感知的多样性。模型不能很好地模拟不同群体的观点差异。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好校准的模型，以考虑不同人群视角的多样性，提高性别歧视检测的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在中文量词预测任务上表现不如BERT模型，即使经过微调也难以超越，双向注意力机制在此任务中具有明显优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文量词是汉语的重要特征，正确预测量词对教育应用至关重要，但主流大语言模型是否具备正确的中文量词知识尚未得到充分研究

Method: 采用多种掩码策略评估LLMs的内在能力，分析不同句子元素的贡献，研究注意力机制在预测过程中的作用，并探索通过微调提升模型性能

Result: LLMs在中文量词预测任务上的表现不如BERT，预测主要受益于后续名词信息，双向注意力机制模型（如BERT）在此任务中具有优势

Conclusion: 当前主流大语言模型在中文量词知识方面存在不足，双向架构的模型更适合处理此类需要上下文信息的语言任务

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个基于知识图谱的多链推理框架，通过并行推理链和交叉验证解决医疗问答中的错误累积问题，在多个基准测试中超越GPT-4o和其他基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在医疗问答中存在单链推理导致的错误累积问题，且缺乏结构化的知识整合，无法满足医疗领域对准确性和可追溯性的严格要求。

Method: 提出MIRAGE框架：1)将复杂查询分解为基于实体的子问题；2)执行并行推理链；3)通过邻居扩展和多跳遍历自适应检索证据；4)使用交叉链验证整合答案解决矛盾。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试(GenMedGPT-5k、CMCQA、ExplainCPE)上，MIRAGE在自动和人工评估中均优于GPT-4o、Tree-of-Thought变体和其他检索增强基线方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过结构化知识图谱上的动态多链推理，显著提升了医疗问答的准确性和可解释性，为复杂医疗推理场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and
shared datasets for evaluating and comparing different approaches. To address
this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a
unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air
robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition,
utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding
attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches.
Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation
trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34
garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the
trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong
achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between
competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of
independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The
associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp
selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our
benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future
benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth
manipulation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业基础设施（如通风管道）的人工检查危险且低效，无人机是替代方案，但GPS拒止环境需要鲁棒的控制策略

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境中的程序生成管道环境，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点，对碰撞施加重罚，比较PPO和SAC算法

Result: PPO学会了稳定策略，完成所有评估无碰撞，轨迹平滑；SAC收敛到次优行为，仅通过初始段就失败

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法（PPO）的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法（SAC）的样本效率；程序生成的高保真仿真是开发和基准测试导航策略的有效平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于李群切空间的广义常扭运动先验，用于水下近距离操作中目标6自由度运动估计，通过三元因子和闭式雅可比矩阵实现跨表示的一致性轨迹估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下近距离操作中目标6自由度运动估计困难，因为缺乏目标侧本体感知，相对观测稀疏、噪声大且部分（如USBL位置）。无运动先验时，因子图最大后验估计欠约束，连续目标状态关联弱，姿态易漂移

Method: 提出广义常扭运动先验，定义在李群切空间上，确保所有自由度的时间一致性轨迹；在SE(3)中耦合体坐标系下的平移和旋转。开发三元因子并推导闭式雅可比矩阵，支持任意李群轨迹的即插即用

Result: 在真实动态对接场景数据集上验证，通过仅USBL和光学相对测量段实现一致的自我-目标轨迹估计，相比噪声测量提高了相对跟踪精度

Conclusion: 该方法基于标准李群原语构建，可跨状态流形和感知模态移植，为水下近距离操作提供了有效的6-DoF运动估计解决方案

Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is
difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available
relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short
Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a
posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly
linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist
motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces
temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it
couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor
and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations,
enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two
deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation
even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that
switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying
the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes.
Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent
ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative
measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to
the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on
standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and
sensing modalities.

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world
sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: HDSim通过结合认知理论和LLM辅助，成功解决了交通仿真中驾驶行为多样性和真实性的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的可靠性评估提供了更有效的测试环境。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了较MAC方法32倍的CPU时间加速，保持相当的准确性

Conclusion: 该双空间方法能够有效结合两种匹配方法的优势，在保证准确性的同时显著提升计算效率

Abstract: Rigid registration, aiming to estimate a rigid transformation to align source
and target data, play a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and 3D
reconstruction. However, noisy, partially overlapping data and the need for
real-time processing pose major challenges for rigid registration. Considering
that feature-based matching can handle large transformation differences but
suffers from limited accuracy, while local geometry-based matching can achieve
fine-grained local alignment but relies heavily on a good initial
transformation, we propose a novel dual-space paradigm to fully leverage the
strengths of both approaches. First, we introduce an efficient filtering
mechanism that incorporates a computationally lightweight single-point RANSAC
algorithm followed by a refinement module to eliminate unreliable feature-based
correspondences. Subsequently, we treat filtered correspondences as anchor
points, extract geometric proxies, and formulates an effective objective
function with a tailored solver to estimate the transformation. Experiments
verify our method's effectiveness, as shown by achieving up to a 32x CPU-time
speedup over MAC on KITTI with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.

language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner.
We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven
framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Abstract: Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually
has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate
diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust
learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge,
we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that
leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise
and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder
for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these
learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on
the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization
technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for
grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp
synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating
robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other
approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to
real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful
grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration
errors.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Result: 实验结果表明，事件引导的策略在各种操作条件下始终具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: 事件驱动感知有潜力改善实时机器人导航和操作，为事件相机更广泛地集成到机器人策略学习中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

TL;DR: 开源双足机器人MEVITA，采用金属板焊接结构，通过电商平台可获取所有零件，实现了简单组装和稳健行走性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开源双足机器人存在的问题：3D打印机器人维度限制和结构脆弱，金属机器人零件数量过多组装困难且零件获取不便。

Method: 采用金属板焊接技术将复杂结构集成到单个零件中，大幅减少组件数量。通过模拟环境中的强化学习和模拟到实际的转移技术实现行走控制。

Result: 成功开发出MEVITA双足机器人，在多种环境下展现出稳健的行走行为，验证了方案的有效性。

Conclusion: MEVITA作为一个全面开源的平台，提供了从硬件、软件到训练环境的完整解决方案，为双足机器人的普及和发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Various bipedal robots have been developed to date, and in recent years,
there has been a growing trend toward releasing these robots as open-source
platforms. This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely
develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on
commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are
designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in
size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some
metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a
large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the
parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To
address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that
can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the
minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal
welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby
significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for
anyone. Through reinforcement learning in simulation and Sim-to-Real transfer,
we demonstrated robust walking behaviors across various environments,
confirming the effectiveness of our approach. All hardware, software, and
training environments can be obtained from https://github.com/haraduka/mevita .

Motivation: 现实世界中的ASR系统需要处理不完美的音频和多样化用户群体，特别是在人机交互(HRI)环境中，这些挑战交织在一起形成了独特的识别困难

Method: 在8个公开数据集上评估4个最先进的ASR系统，这些数据集涵盖了6个难度维度：领域特定、口音、噪声、年龄变化、语音障碍和自发语音

Result: 分析显示在标准基准测试得分相似的情况下，系统在性能、幻觉倾向和内在偏见方面存在显著差异

Conclusion: 这些限制对HRI有严重影响，识别错误会干扰任务执行、用户信任和安全性

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

TL;DR: 提出了FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，能够根据上下文条件动态调整轨迹预测的时间步长，解决了传统固定长度预测模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹预测模型使用固定长度的输出预测，无法适应动态变化的真实场景需求，需要一种能够根据上下文条件动态调整预测步长的解决方案。

Method: 设计了FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)来动态评估和调整输出步长，动态解码器(DD)确保即插即用，以及评分机制平衡预测步长和准确性。

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的大量实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: FSN框架通过动态调整预测步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了轨迹预测的适应性和效率，为自动驾驶和智能决策系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

TL;DR: 实时多感官错误反馈在虚拟手术训练中显著提高学习效果，在环形定向和曲线路径准确性方面超过事后反馈和无反馈组


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助微创手术已成为金标准，但最佳训练方法不明。研究考察实时错误反馈是否能比事后反馈更有效提高学习速度和减少错误

Method: 42名手术新手学习虚拟环线任务，分三组：(1)实时错误反馈(触觉+视觉)，(2)事后回放反馈，(3)无反馈。评估环的位置和方向准确性

Result: 实时反馈组在环形定向方面表现最佳；事后反馈组在直线路段定向方面超过无反馈组；实时反馈组在曲线路段位置准确性最高；各组在总体位置准确性无显著差异

Conclusion: 实时多感官错误反馈能够显著提高虚拟手术训练的学习效果，比事后反馈或无反馈更有效，有助于手术学员更快速和准确地发展手术技能

Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the
gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of
training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather
than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce
errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the
ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the
impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three
groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and
(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on
the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who
received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.
Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed
participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during
long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between
groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time
feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved
path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error
feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error
feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work
demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to
better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task
completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to
develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: CubeDN是一个专为无人机3D检测设计的单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，通过双雷达配置和深度学习管道解决毫米波雷达在高度测量方面的限制，实现了分米级跟踪精度和实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机的广泛使用，需要确保安全和安保。光学传感器在恶劣光照和环境条件下性能下降，毫米波雷达成为更可靠的替代方案，但现有系统主要专注于2D道路用户检测，缺乏对无人机3D检测所需的高度测量能力。

Method: 提出CubeDN单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置来克服高度分辨率差的问题，使用新颖的深度学习管道同时实现检测、定位和分类功能。

Result: 系统能够同时检测和分类两种尺寸的无人机，在较近距离实现分米级跟踪精度，整体平均精度(AP)达到95%，平均召回率(AR)达到85%，数据处理和推理速度达到10Hz。

Conclusion: CubeDN通过创新的双雷达配置和深度学习架构，成功解决了毫米波雷达在无人机3D检测中的高度测量挑战，实现了高精度、高实时性的无人机检测系统，非常适合实际应用。

Abstract: As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure
safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone
detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR
are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under
adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated
interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave
(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has
predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems
demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing
capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To
address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object
detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes
challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar
configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,
localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level
tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP)
and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing
and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-交互三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大语言模型的"搜索验证"管道来预测交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有affordance研究忽视了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的操作区域和方向，这限制了智能机器人的物体操作能力。

Method: 构建egocentric视角数据集，提出"search against verifiers"管道，让大语言模型迭代预测affordance并在每一步进行自我验证，模拟推理过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了新的指令导向affordance预测能力，而且在广泛任务上取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令依赖的affordance概念对于智能机器人操作至关重要，基于大语言模型的搜索验证方法能有效预测不同指令下的交互能力。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external
monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel
AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and
solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring
system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying
driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition
a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring
system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform
thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,
external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D
point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of
EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on
a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and
evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy,
highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the
proposed perception architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在不确定条件下的安全性需要感知和决策的无缝集成。虽然YOLO等计算机视觉模型在检测交通标志和障碍物方面具有高精度，但在天气变化或未见物体导致的漂移场景中性能会下降。

Method: 开发了一个模拟自动驾驶系统，将上下文感知的CV模型与基于ADORE框架的自适应控制相结合。通过ROS桥接将CARLA模拟器与ADORE集成，实现感知、决策和控制模块之间的实时通信。

Result: 在清晰和恶劣天气条件下的模拟测试表明，感知模型具有鲁棒的检测性能，ADORE成功适应了车速限制和障碍物，具有低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将基于深度学习的感知与基于规则的自适应决策相结合，有望提高汽车安全关键系统的性能。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires a seamless integration of
perception and decision making under uncertain conditions. Although computer
vision (CV) models such as YOLO achieve high accuracy in detecting traffic
signs and obstacles, their performance degrades in drift scenarios caused by
weather variations or unseen objects. This work presents a simulated autonomous
driving system that combines a context aware CV model with adaptive control
using the ADORE framework. The CARLA simulator was integrated with ADORE via
the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,
and control modules. A simulated test case was designed in both clear and drift
weather conditions to demonstrate the robust detection performance of the
perception model while ADORE successfully adapted vehicle behavior to speed
limits and obstacles with low response latency. The findings highlight the
potential of coupling deep learning-based perception with rule-based adaptive
decision making to improve automotive safety critical system.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的方法，主要创新在于利用覆盖敏感皮肤的完整机器人表面进行接触感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人定位和抓取物体主要依赖视觉传感器，触觉反馈通常只是辅助手段。本研究旨在探索在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈完成物体搜索和抓取任务的可行性。

Method: 将搜索分为两个阶段：(1) 使用完整机器人表面进行粗略的工作空间探索；(2) 使用配备力/力矩传感器的末端执行器进行精确定位。该方法在仿真和真实机器人上进行了系统评估。

Result: 在真实机器人上，单个物体的整体成功率达到85.7%，失败主要出现在抓取特定物体时。相比仅使用末端执行器触觉反馈的基线方法，这种全身接触方法速度快6倍。还展示了在桌面上定位和抓取多个物体的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不限于特定设置，可部署在任何具有全身表面接触感知能力的平台上，在视觉感知具有挑战性的领域（如农业中在枝叶内定位和采摘水果蔬菜）具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using
visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only
secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of
searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying
on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the
complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search
is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete
robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector
equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in
simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be
located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real
robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific
objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a
baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show
locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not
restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the
ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds
promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception
(due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or
vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

Motivation: 移动机器人遥操作中的通信延迟严重影响人机协作，但之前缺乏对延迟如何影响人类操作性能和神经认知的系统研究。

Method: 采用人在环实验，招募10名参与者，结合脑电图(EEG)和机器人行为数据，在0-500ms延迟范围内以100ms为增量进行系统研究。

Result: 行为分析显示200-300ms延迟导致性能显著下降；EEG分析发现前额θ/β波段和顶叶α波段功率具有显著延迟依赖性；识别出100-200ms的早期感知窗口；400ms以上延迟时所有特征趋于平稳。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了人类在遥操作任务中感知和认知延迟阈值的证据，为延迟补偿策略的设计提供了关键的神经认知学见解。

Abstract: Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect
human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational
performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,
no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a
human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating
electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays
(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.
Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms
delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers
features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and
parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)
for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first
exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features
plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at
physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual
and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering
critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation
strategies.

Conclusion: 混合驱动方法具有鲁棒性，腿部和推进器的战略协同是实现稳定混合 locomotion 的关键，需要针对不同相位制定特定的控制策略。

Abstract: This study presents an analysis of experimental data from Harpy, a
thruster-assisted bipedal robot developed at Northeastern University. The study
examines data sets from trotting and jumping experiments to understand the
fundamental principles governing hybrid leg-thruster locomotion. Through data
analysis across multiple locomotion modes, this research reveals that Harpy
achieves stable locomotion with bounded trajectories and consistent foot
placement through strategic leg-thruster synergy. The results demonstrate
controlled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate
foot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition
perturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without
divergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,
while the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis
identifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that
require phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and
symmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation
approach.

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video
demo.

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: SafeBimanual框架有效提升了双臂操作的安全性和成功率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

Conclusion: 该方法为世界建模提供了更原则性的基础，通过解耦动态学习改善了视觉预测质量和策略学习效率。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model
trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with
physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often
resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To
address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual
CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a
scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this
principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after
generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes
motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning
process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the
model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent
visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments
on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a
more principled foundation for world modeling. Project page:
