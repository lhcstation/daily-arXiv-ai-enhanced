Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,\nrequires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,\nespecially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable\nand dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on\npredefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.\nTo address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map\nto evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we\nintroduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning\n(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and\nUAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between\nthe representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse\ndata sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to\nbalance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time\npath planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach\nenables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and\nenhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u548cMSHA-RL\u6846\u67b6\u7684UAM\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5ba2\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\uff08UAM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e58\u5ba2\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMSHA-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u969c\u4e58\u5ba2\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "MSHA-RL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aUAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to\nadapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion\nrequirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate\nconstraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called\nBT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and\nDynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this\nframework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex,\nlong-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are\nsystematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level\ndecision-making task structure.

These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints. Prior works have explored object\npose reorientation such as pivoting by utilizing extrinsic contacts between an\nobject and an environment feature like a wall, to make the object graspable.\nHowever, such works often assume the presence of a short wall, and this\nassumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios. If the wall available\nfor interaction is too large or too tall, the robot may still fail to grasp the\nobject even after pivoting, and the robot must combine different types of\nactions to grasp. To address this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework. We use Q-learning to train a high-level policy that\nselects the type of action expected to yield the highest reward. The selected\nlow-level skill then samples a specific robot action in continuous space. To\nguide the robot to an appropriate location for executing the selected action,\nwe adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We condition the CVAE on\nthe object point cloud and the skill ID, enabling it to infer a suitable\nlocation based on the object geometry and the selected skill. To promote\ngeneralization, we apply domain randomization during the training of low-level\nskills. The RL policy is trained entirely in simulation with a box-like object\nand deployed to six objects in real world.

Building on this\nfoundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting\nstrategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a\nhigh-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource\nlanguage. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates\nby up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across\nlanguage pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCCL-XCoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aCCL-XCoT\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e62%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "CCL-XCoT\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

As a result, platforms that host models and\ndatasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular\nplatforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no\nsign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained\nmodels, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or\nmalicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical\nto understand the origin and development of these components to better detect\npotential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by\nthis, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,\nwhich are core components of the LLM supply chain.

Using this data, we build a\ndirected heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and\ndatasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges.

Furthermore, to\nfacilitate the integration of local detail information into the global\nstructure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel\ninteraction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across\ndifferent granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to\nexisting methods.

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our\nmethod eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces\ncomputational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge\ndevices.

Recent methods based on cross-modal learning\nattempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.\nHowever, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their\ngeneration abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented\npoint cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal\nretrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from\nsimilar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature\nEncoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct\nreference features as priors.

Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to\nreliably detect meaningful CPS indicators.

Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models.

However, data-driven inertial localization methods\noften rely on increasingly complex network architectures to improve accuracy,\nwhich challenges the limited computational resources of IoT devices. Moreover,\nthese methods frequently overlook the importance of modeling long-term\ndependencies in inertial measurements - a critical factor for accurate\ntrajectory reconstruction - thereby limiting localization performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a reparameterized inertial localization\nnetwork that uses a multi-branch structure during training to enhance feature\nextraction. At inference time, this structure is transformed into an equivalent\nsingle-path architecture to improve parameter efficiency. To further capture\nlong-term dependencies in motion trajectories, we introduce a temporal-scale\nsparse attention mechanism that selectively emphasizes key trajectory segments\nwhile suppressing noise. Additionally, a gated convolutional unit is\nincorporated to effectively integrate long-range dependencies with local\nfine-grained features. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and model\ncompactness.

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements.

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating\nthrough such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency\ncomponents within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a\npotential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nin vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are\nprone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary\nexteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are\nlater initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained\nby the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper\nproposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements\ninto UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of\nSLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using\nUWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless\nareas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses\nprevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents\nsolutions to overcome them.

Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were\ndesigned and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism\ncould reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism\nwas able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy,\nwhereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less\nthan 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting\nflowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a\nline of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the\nheight of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to\nkeep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers,\nwhile minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was\nperformed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in\nkiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only\nprovides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the\namount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other\nobjects in the orchards.

Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility.

To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

This surge\npresents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable\npre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge\nlies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the\nunderlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning\ndynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely\nalign with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential\nnonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a\nfinetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD\nproposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution\ntoward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware\ndecomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes\nand further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned\noptimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the\ndifferential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively\nbridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning\nprocess.

To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize\nmissing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time\nwhile preserving diagnostic quality.

All\nframeworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three\npublicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and\nqualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms\ndiffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,\nand computational efficiency.

Lastly, the\ninfluence of hyperparameters on tracking error is investigated through\nsimulation. The proposed method has been validated on a real FCRA platform,\nincluding five-point positioning accuracy tests, a five-point response tracking\ntest, and trajectory tracking for letter drawing. The results demonstrate that\nthe average positioning accuracy is approximately 2.070 mm.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space.

Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more\nrigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or\nviscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically\npost-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,\nconstrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is\npioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous\nmonitoring of food consumption.

Unlike conventional\ndifferentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and\ntypically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF\nlearns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on\npredicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate,\nequally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal\nfiltering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios,\nincluding both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on\nsimulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms\nexisting filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8%\nimprovement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization\nbenchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry\nbenchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters.

In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination\npathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)\ninstances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening\nthe alignment across modalities.

On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware\nsupport of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive\nrobot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision\ninputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,\nuniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how\nincorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both\nefficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors.

Meanwhile, conventional GSR\nmodels often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen\nand rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information.

In the United States, individuals\nfrom lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced\nstages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid\nconditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a\nnovel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and\ncomorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical\ndeferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment\nwith three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully\nconnected layer as the most versatile methodology.

Together, these\ndesigns make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps\nand spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient\nbackpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15\npercent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency\nresults that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent\nparameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability\npractical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing\ngap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Vision Transformers\u5728HSI\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5149\u8c31\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684[SINK]\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "HSI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97ViTs\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\uff0cFOCUS\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "FOCUS\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5149\u8c31\u63d0\u793a\u548c[SINK]\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u751f\u62103D\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "FOCUS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7ea7IoU\uff0815%\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0840%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ViT\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aHSI\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address the\nchallenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual\ntask Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target\nimage pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of\nlow-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing\nbackbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible\nintegration with various architectures and effective utilization of\ntask-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a\nunified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across\nmultiple representative tasks.

Although downstream tasks of\ninterest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to\nchoose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes\nautomatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging\nbenchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has\nsignificantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high\nmemory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in\nreal-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything\n(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM\noften generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.\nTherefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline\ncurve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the\nrobust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a\nfour-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed\nto effectively smooth jagged edges.

Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference\nstage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization\nintegrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for\nenhanced facial fidelity.

This is\nachieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D\nvertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the\nstructure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,\na denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)\nMamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape\nand pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can\ngenerate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and\noutperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.\nAdditionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric\nhuman mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses\nusing around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,\nwhile achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeshMamba\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMamba-SSMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u62103D\u5173\u8282\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8fc710,000\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8863\u7269\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u7f51\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8863\u7269\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u9876\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5e76\u6309\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u6216\u6a21\u677f\u7f51\u683c\u76843D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5229\u7528Mamba-SSMs\u5904\u7406\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MambaDiff3D\uff08\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cMamba-HMR\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "MambaDiff3D\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u8863\u7269\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bMamba-HMR\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6062\u590d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MeshMamba\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures\nabstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained\ndescription that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their\nsurrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial\ncorrespondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground\nsegmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions.

Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of\ndetail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data\nprovenance, usage rights, and user consent.

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization.

This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg).

However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEVA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "EVA\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EVA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff08SeC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u89c2\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5267\u70c8\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "SeC\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LVLMs\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5e27\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SeCVOS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSeC\u6bd4SAM 2.1\u63d0\u5347\u4e8611.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SeC\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}
