Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架用于检测针对女性的冒犯性内容，包括三个模块，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的冒犯性内容较多，现有方法难以检测，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 框架包含多模态注意力模块（MANM）、基于图的特征重构模块（GFRM）和内容特定特征学习模块（CFLM），并利用词典和测试时增强技术。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，宏F1平均提升10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了针对女性的冒犯性内容检测性能。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [2] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升了不同架构和规模的视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，视觉语言模型虽有优势但表现不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强感知能力；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从感知到解释的飞跃。

Result: 在7个VLMs上显著提升，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型在零样本设置下超越商业模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1在工业异常检测中表现出高效性和优越性，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合视觉语言模型和粒子滤波，提高检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于视觉变化或依赖黑盒模型，缺乏语义推理能力和可解释性。

Method: CADAR融合多模态视觉语言输入，生成符号感知图，结合先验知识和粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提高10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中表现出高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转化为隐私保护的文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及导致隐私与数据需求之间的严重冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，生成兼具语义准确性和隐私保护的文本描述。

Result: RL-MoE显著降低重放攻击成功率至9.4%，同时生成比基线方法更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

### [5] [Synthetic Data Generation for Emotional Depth Faces: Optimizing Conditional DCGANs via Genetic Algorithms in the Latent Space and Stabilizing Training with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09188)
*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,S. Younes Mirinezhad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化GAN和知识蒸馏的合成深度人脸生成框架，结合遗传算法提升多样性和质量，在情感分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量、多样化深度人脸数据集的缺乏问题，以识别细微情感表达。

Method: 使用优化的GAN和知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）稳定训练，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，情感分类准确率达94%和96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成深度人脸和情感分类任务中显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，仅需20%数据即可实现最佳性能，训练速度提升5倍，准确率提高10.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）对视觉语言模型（VLMs）至关重要，但数据选择问题尚未充分研究。现有方法需大量数据且难以保证质量与对齐。

Method: 提出Δ-AttnMask框架，通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态的损失差异（Δ），无需额外标签或训练即可评估样本质量。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅需20%数据即可达到最优性能，训练速度提升5倍，准确率比全数据集基线高10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask是一种模型无关、数据无关的通用框架，适用于多种模态和架构，显著提升了VIF的效率与性能。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

### [7] [Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202)
*Masoumeh Sharafi,Soufiane Belharbi,Houssem Ben Salem,Ali Etemad,Alessandro Lameiras Koerich,Marco Pedersoli,Simon Bacon,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为个性化特征翻译（PFT）的方法，用于解决源数据不可用且目标数据仅包含中性表情的无监督域适应问题。PFT在潜在空间操作，避免了复杂的图像生成，提高了效率和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度FER模型在细微表情和高个体差异下表现不佳，且传统SFDA方法无法适应仅含单类（中性表情）的目标数据。

Method: 提出PFT方法，先在源域数据上预训练翻译器，优化表情一致性和风格感知目标；随后在仅含中性表情的目标数据上适应翻译器，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT避免了图像生成的复杂性和噪声，生成优化的分类嵌入，计算开销低，效率高。

Conclusion: PFT为无源数据的单类目标域适应提供了一种轻量级解决方案，显著提升了FER模型的实用性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MME-Emotion基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感知觉和推理能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感计算领域缺乏全面评估MLLMs情感智能的基准，尤其是在泛化能力和推理能力方面。

Method: 通过构建包含6,000多个视频片段和任务特定问答对的MME-Emotion基准，结合混合指标和多代理系统框架进行评估。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLMs，发现其情感智能表现不佳，最佳模型识别得分仅39.3%，推理得分56.0%。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion为未来提升MLLMs情感智能提供了基础，并揭示了通用模型和专用模型的差异。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四轴评估框架和递归重写策略（BSD），用于更准确地评估和提升对抗性提示的攻击效果，揭示了当前多模态安全系统的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准可能高估对抗性提示的攻击效果，且安全机制未能有效阻止有害输出。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入主题性、OOD强度、输出危害性、拒绝率），并提出BSD策略，通过语义分解和OOD信号提升攻击效果。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs中显著提高了攻击成功率和危害性，分别提升67%和21%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态安全系统存在未被充分认识的弱点，BSD策略为对抗性攻击提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域因数据稀缺而受限，主要由于手动标注过程费时费力。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的数据引擎，生成复杂且一致的LaTeX序列，构建了Tex80M数据集，并提出了TexTeller模型，通过混合训练Tex80M和少量HME数据实现。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 论文将公开模型、数据集和代码，以推动HMER领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

TL;DR: GDAGS提出了一种基于梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建和过密集问题，显著提升了渲染质量并减少了内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中存在过重建和过密集问题，导致内存开销大和渲染质量下降。

Method: GDAGS通过梯度一致性比率（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现了梯度方向感知的密度控制，优化高斯分布。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过梯度方向感知的密度控制，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中的关键问题，为实时逼真渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FineState-Bench，首个用于评估GUI代理细粒度控制能力的标准框架，并开发了视觉诊断助手（VDA）进行定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理评估框架过于关注粗粒度任务完成，忽略了细粒度控制能力的重要性。

Method: 引入多平台（桌面、Web、移动）的FineState-Bench框架，包含2257个任务基准和四阶段指标，并开发VDA进行视觉定位分析。

Result: 实验显示最先进模型的细粒度交互准确率仅为32.8%，理想视觉定位可提升Gemini-2.5-Flash成功率14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，盲人和低视力用户的隐私问题日益突出，现有方法因粗粒度屏蔽而影响可用性。

Method: 结合细粒度分割与数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上测试，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升模型响应能力11%，识别能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

*Dongwoo Kang,Akhil Perincherry,Zachary Coalson,Aiden Gabriel,Stefan Lee,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航（VLN）模型的效率，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量的同时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图（空间效率）、基于重要性的自适应阈值（模型内效率）、缓存机制（时间效率）。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，实现了计算量减少超过2倍，且性能无明显下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了VLN模型的效率，适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习面临高维输入和噪声奖励的挑战，现有感知模型难以有效整合到RL中。SegDAC旨在解决这一问题，提升视觉泛化和样本效率。

Method: SegDAC结合SAM进行对象分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，采用基于Transformer的动态架构，在线RL学习片段关注。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化上表现优异，最困难场景性能翻倍，样本效率也优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象分解和动态学习机制，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺部癌症诊断中效率低且解剖学不精确，限制了其临床应用。

Method: 采用基于结节语义布局的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM），并通过肺部DPM-solver加速，专注于病变区域。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，Lung-DDPM+实现了8倍FLOPs减少、6.8倍GPU内存降低和14倍采样速度提升，同时保持高质量样本。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖确定性模型完成语义地图，忽略了室内布局的不确定性，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 利用LLM推断空间先验，编码为二维高斯场并注入目标地图，通过生成流模型实现更通用的语义补全。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流模型和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了目标导航任务的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成能有效提升复杂多模态手势识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在天气扰动下性能下降严重，主要受限于有限的天气类别和对场景-天气特征解耦的不足。

Method: 提出Training-free Weather Reasoning机制和多模态动态门控框架，结合图像-文本对比学习优化特征解耦。

Result: 在多种天气条件下，Recall@1显著提升，夜间+13.37%，雾雪+18.69%。

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，显著提升了无人机地理定位在复杂天气下的性能。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

Motivation: 解决CSLR中的Signer-Independent（SI）和Unseen-Sentences（US）挑战，传统方法效率不足。

Method: 提出Signer-Invariant Conformer（结合卷积与多头自注意力）和Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer（双路径时间编码器）。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升CSLR性能，为后续研究奠定新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

Motivation: RANSAC方法在平面检测中因阈值模糊易产生假阳性，尤其在复杂场景中问题显著。

Method: 将深度数据视为离散随机变量，通过随机子采样生成候选平面模型，结合传感器物理和噪声模型计算信息量，选择信息量最少的模型作为真实平面。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比Open3D RANSAC更准确地估计平面参数，并通过神经网络分割加速算法。

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架有效减少了假阳性检测，提升了平面检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在标注者内和标注者间的变异性，尤其是边界模糊的病变（如恶性皮肤病变）更容易引发分歧。研究旨在量化这种变异性并探索其与恶性程度的关系。

Method: 通过IMA++数据集分析了标注者、恶性程度、工具和技能对变异性的影响，并利用Dice系数测量标注者间一致性（IAA）。进一步提出基于IAA的多任务学习框架。

Result: 发现IAA与皮肤病变恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001），并证明IAA可直接从皮肤镜图像预测（平均绝对误差0.108）。多任务学习方法平均提高了4.2%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征的补充信息，多任务学习能有效提升皮肤病变分割的准确性，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Motivation: 现有点跟踪方法难以实现一致的运动或仅限于2D运动，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用可逆神经辐射场（InvNeRF）架构参数化聚合函数，结合多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法，实现2D和3D跟踪。

Result: 在2D点跟踪中，平均精度提升近50%；在3D点跟踪中首次超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术场景中表现出色，结合了可变形NeRF的优势，为点跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Conclusion: X-UniMotion为全身运动迁移提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Result: 在多个SAR数据集上表现优异，SARDet-100K数据集上比DenoDet V1提升0.8%，同时模型复杂度减半。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制实现了性能与效率的双重突破，为SAR目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

### [30] [TRACE: Learning 3D Gaussian Physical Dynamics from Multi-view Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09811)
*Jinxi Li,Ziyang Song,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRACE框架通过将3D点建模为刚性粒子，直接学习每个粒子的平移旋转动力学系统，无需人工标签即可建模复杂动态3D场景的运动物理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过物理约束或简单物理模型难以学习复杂运动物理，且需要额外标签。TRACE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并显式估计物理参数。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现优异，尤其在未来帧外推任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACE无需标签即可建模复杂物理运动，并能通过聚类物理参数轻松分割多物体或部件。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，能够通过单次前向传播在未见数据集上成功重建3D表面。

Conclusion: RayletDF在3D表面重建中表现出高效性和强大的泛化能力，适用于多种输入数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了大规模高质量的路缘坡道检测数据集、基准和模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义及其空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PaIR-Net框架，包含CPAM、PGCS和IIM三个模块，用于识别接触相关身体部位、像素级接触分割和全局关系整合。

Result: PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和配套数据集PaIR为动作与空间上下文联合建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning（MPT）的新方法，通过微调大型预训练模型（LMs）来改进微表情识别（MER），解决了现有方法难以捕捉细微面部动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别在医疗诊断、测谎等领域有广泛应用，但由于标注困难导致训练样本稀缺，且现有预训练模型难以捕捉微表情的短暂和细微特征。

Method: 提出MPT方法，包括运动提示生成（运动放大和高斯标记化）和组适配器设计，以增强预训练模型在MER任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个常用MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT通过运动提示和适配器设计，成功提升了MER任务的性能，为微表情识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索的增强超分辨率方法（RASR），通过自动从数据库中检索相关高分辨率图像来提升低质量输入图像的纹理和视觉真实感，解决了传统RefSR依赖手动配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。论文旨在通过自动检索相关参考图像，提高RefSR的实用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出RASR框架，包括语义参考检索器和基于扩散的RefSR生成器。构建RASR-Flickr30基准数据集，支持开放世界检索。

Result: RASRNet在RASR-Flickr30上表现优于SISR基线，PSNR提升0.38 dB，LPIPS降低0.0131，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究与实际应用的有效方向，RASR为RefSR的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: HyperKD为高光谱遥感中的基础模型应用提供了有效解决方案，展示了知识蒸馏框架的潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Conclusion: Animate-X++在拟人角色动画和动态背景生成方面具有显著优势，并通过新基准A2Bench验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现出色，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出IAG方法，利用文本条件U-Net生成自适应触发器，嵌入目标语义信息，并通过重构损失确保攻击隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明IAG在InternVL-2.5-8B上ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上表现出色。

Conclusion: IAG是一种高效、隐蔽且可迁移的后门攻击方法，对视觉语言模型的安全性提出了新挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Result: 在生成表情的准确性、身份保留及一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEN-AFFECT在生成个性化虚拟形象方面表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Method: 提出局部-全局交叉注意力网络、分层分类策略和两阶段训练方法，使用铰链损失增强特征可分性。

Result: 在九个封闭集基准测试中达到SOTA性能，首次实现不依赖视觉信息的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: CitySeg通过创新方法显著提升了城市规模点云分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的少样本深度伪造检测方法FTNet，通过利用少量样本显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，深度伪造检测模型在未知样本上表现不佳，但这些样本仍可用于分析。传统方法依赖大规模已知数据训练，而FTNet仅需一个伪造样本即可工作。

Method: FTNet无需训练或参数更新，仅需一个伪造样本作为参考。测试样本通过与已知伪造和真实样本比较进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型的测试中，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新的SoTA水平。

Conclusion: FTNet为深度伪造检测提供了新思路：利用失败样本可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在大角度面部变化时难以保持身份一致性，主要因缺乏有效机制整合身份特征和针对大角度面部数据不足。

Method: 引入MoFE动态结合三种专家模型（身份、语义、细节），并设计数据处理流程（面部约束和身份一致性）构建LFA数据集。

Result: 实验表明，结合LFA数据集的方法在面部相似性、FID和CLIP语义对齐上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部视频生成中的身份保持问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Motivation: 随着AI生成图像质量接近真实图像，现有检测器对未知生成模型的检测性能有限，需改进。

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像检测有效。

Conclusion: 该方法无需AI生成图像即可训练，具有泛化能力，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

TL;DR: GazeLT是一种结合人类视觉注意力机制的长尾疾病分类方法，通过整合和解构放射科医生的眼动模式，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生的视觉注意力模式包含细粒度和粗粒度疾病信息，将其融入深度学习框架可提升自动化图像解读能力。同时，专家不仅关注主要疾病模式，还会注意到次要/偶发发现（长尾类），这对长尾分类至关重要。

Method: GazeLT利用视觉搜索过程的时间特性，通过整合和解构机制，改进长尾疾病分类。

Result: 在NIH-CXR-LT和MIMIC-CXR-LT数据集上，GazeLT比最佳长尾损失方法提升4.1%，比基于视觉注意力的基线方法提升21.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: GazeLT通过结合人类视觉注意力机制，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能，为自动化图像解读提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

TL;DR: SkySplat是一种自监督框架，将RPC模型集成到通用3DGS中，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS方法在稀疏卫星图像重建中与RPC模型不兼容及泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 结合RPC模型和通用3DGS，引入CSCM模块和多视角一致性策略，仅需RGB图像和相对高度监督。

Result: 速度提升86倍，MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，在DFC19和MVS3D数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SkySplat在稀疏卫星图像重建中高效且准确，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: Video-EM框架通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的局限性，提升了关键帧选择和问答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时忽略了时空关系，导致关键帧冗余和信息丢失，影响视频问答的准确性。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序事件，结合链式思维（CoT）迭代选择最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过时空建模和高效记忆选择，显著提升了长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展引发了对其滥用的担忧，现有检测方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能显著下降。

Method: 提出SARE方法，通过测量图像与其基于标题的重建之间的语义差异来检测假图像。

Result: 实验表明，SARE在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARE是一种鲁棒的检测特征，能够跨不同生成模型实现泛化检测。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖图表示和语言模型编码器，忽略了关键的几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Method: CWFBind在特征提取阶段整合局部曲率描述符，增强几何表示，并引入度感知权重机制和动态半径策略。

Result: 实验表明，CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现优异，平衡了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何特征和动态策略显著提升了分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，因数据有限、声学阴影和散斑噪声等问题。因此，构建一个适用于多异构超声数据集的通用框架至关重要。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家，创建通用表示空间，并与特定源专家协作，提取互补的判别性特征。

Conclusion: COME通过结合跨数据集经验分布和通用超声先验，实现了对小批量或未见数据的鲁棒泛化，为超声图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network

Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and

Motivation: 研究旨在解决现实图像数据集中稀有场景和高噪声的问题，利用合成数据的优势提升开源模型的性能。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调Bagel模型，同时提出GenEval++和Imagine-Bench两个新评估基准。

Result: Echo-4o在标准基准测试中表现优异，且数据集对其他基础模型（如OmniGen2、BLIP3-o）也有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据在补充现实数据集和提升模型性能方面具有显著潜力，Echo-4o-Image展示了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

*Yuxin Mao,Zhen Qin,Jinxing Zhou,Bin Fan,Jing Zhang,Yiran Zhong,Yuchao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDT提出了一种基于内容感知的空间衰减机制，改进了传统ViT在空间任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务中表现不佳。现有方法使用固定距离度量的空间衰减，限制了适应性。

Method: 提出SDT，引入Context-Aware Gating (CAG)机制，生成动态、数据依赖的空间衰减，结合内容相关性和空间邻近性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SDT为ViT中的空间注意力增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测量阶段缺乏非相干性，重建阶段缺乏显式测量表示，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出AKCS模型提高测量非相干性，MACA机制学习隐式测量表示，并整合为MEUNet。

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合有效解决了现有方法的不足，显著提升了压缩感知任务的表现。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机场景中，RGBT图像中的微小目标检测面临空间错位、低光照和复杂背景等挑战，现有方法难以有效利用多模态信息。

Method: 提出COXNet框架，包括跨层融合模块、动态对齐与尺度细化模块，以及基于GeoShape相似度的标签分配策略。

Result: 在RGBTDronePerson数据集上，COXNet比现有方法提升了3.32%的mAP50。

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出鲁棒的检测能力，为RGBT微小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对非对称立体视觉的双阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），通过结合两种成本体积构建方法，解决了视觉不对称对立体匹配的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非对称多相机系统（如长焦-广角相机）的兴起挑战了传统立体匹配算法中对称视觉特性的假设，导致匹配困难。

Method: 研究分析了两种成本体积构建方法在非对称立体视觉中的匹配成本分布，提出双阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，再融合两者以增强细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在非对称场景下表现优异，对分辨率和颜色退化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IVF-AStereo有效解决了非对称立体视觉中的匹配问题，并通过基准数据集和消融实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

TL;DR: GoViG任务通过原始视觉数据生成导航指令，分解为视觉预测和指令生成两个子任务，采用多模态大语言模型，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入，GoViG仅用原始视觉数据，提升对未知和非结构化环境的适应性。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉预测和指令生成，采用多模态大语言模型，结合一阶和交错推理策略。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优异，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过视觉预测和指令生成的结合，实现了高效且适应性强的导航指令生成。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Conclusion: 研究为合成数据增强提供了量化指导，并揭示了其效果与基线训练集规模和合成数据量的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于现有算法，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法有效解决了复杂光照条件下的曝光校正问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在临床效果和可解释性方面表现不佳，尤其是对病灶属性的描述。

Method: 提出CoD框架，通过诊断对话生成问答对提取关键发现，结合大型语言模型生成报告，并设计诊断和病灶定位模块增强可解释性。采用全监督学习策略利用多类型标注数据。

Result: CoD在两个RRG基准测试中优于专家和通用模型，能准确将生成句子与问答诊断和图像关联，显著提升可解释性。

Conclusion: CoD框架通过结合诊断对话和大型语言模型，显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和可解释性，为临床实践提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型（如Ctrl-X和FreeControl）在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: DRF系统通过外观反馈和生成反馈递归优化中间潜在表示，以更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义一致且结构稳定的图像，支持跨类别的结构-外观融合（如将人类动作转移到老虎形态）。

Conclusion: DRF是一种有效的训练免费方法，显著提升了可控T2I模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在幻觉问题，现有研究在评估上缺乏细粒度分析，且依赖高成本人工或公共数据集。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建管道和分层幻觉诱导框架，构建SHALE基准，包含30K+图像-指令对，覆盖12个视觉感知方面和6个知识领域。

Result: 实验表明主流LVLMs存在显著的事实性幻觉，并对语义扰动高度敏感。

Conclusion: SHALE基准为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了可扩展、可控且多样化的评估工具。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持实时外观编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head为头像建模提供了高质量、高灵活性的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

Conclusion: FaME通过负引导有效提升扩散模型的感知质量，是一种实用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: BridgeTA是一种低成本的知识蒸馏框架，通过教师助理网络缩小LiDAR-Camera融合与纯相机模型之间的表示差距，同时保持学生模型架构和推理成本不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯相机方法在BEV地图分割任务中表现不如LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师架构增加学生模型复杂度，导致推理成本上升。

Method: 引入轻量级教师助理网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，创建共享潜在空间，并使用Young不等式推导蒸馏损失，优化知识传递。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BridgeTA比纯相机基线提升4.2% mIoU，优于其他最先进知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: BridgeTA通过教师助理网络和理论驱动的蒸馏损失，有效提升了纯相机模型的性能，同时保持低成本。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

TL;DR: MInDI-3D是一种基于3D条件扩散的模型，用于稀疏视图CBCT伪影去除，显著降低辐射暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少医学成像中的辐射暴露，并扩展2D方法到3D。

Method: 采用迭代去噪过程，直接从稀疏视图输入优化CBCT体积，并使用大量伪CBCT数据集训练模型。

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上，PSNR增益达12.96 dB，辐射暴露减少8倍，且性能与3D U-Net相当。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在临床评估中表现优异，适用于多种解剖部位，并保持肿瘤边界清晰。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAD-Splat的新方法，用于解决3D航空场景语义分割中的语义模糊问题，通过高斯点丢弃模块和高置信度伪标签生成管道提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在3D航空场景语义分割中难以处理尺度变化和结构遮挡导致的语义模糊，限制了分割精度和一致性。

Method: 引入高斯点丢弃模块（基于Hard Concrete分布）和高置信度伪标签生成管道，结合2D基础模型增强监督。

Result: SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了良好平衡，并在新数据集3D-AS上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高精度模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上仍不完美，纹理对齐可能是一种未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个轻量级纹理模块，将像素观测嵌入UV纹理空间，并引入密集对齐损失函数，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型。

Result: 该方法提升了HaMeR模型的精度和真实感，验证了外观对齐在手部重建中的价值。

Conclusion: 纹理对齐是一种有效的监督信号，可显著提升3D手部重建的性能。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比融合提升特征表示，支持更准确和一致的临床诊断，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Result: PG-SAM在三个独立临床中心表现优异，验证其临床实用性和诊断文本的有效性。

Conclusion: PG-SAM通过结合专家知识，显著提升了腮腺病变分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样有效提升了生成数据的质量，为人脸识别模型的训练提供了更优的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GSFixer通过多特征融合有效提升3DGS重建质量，为稀疏视图问题提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在参考图像和目标图像姿态不同时，区域级颜色一致性表现不佳。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，定性和定量评估均显著提升。

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制隐式发现语义对应，有效提升线稿着色质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: 解决资源受限临床环境中多模态医学影像数据的存储和传输挑战。

Method: 利用生成式视觉语言模型的交叉注意力分数对胸部X光进行结构性剪枝，生成高度压缩的图表示，并与临床报告知识图融合。

Result: 在肺炎检测任务中，NEURAL实现93.4-97.7%的数据压缩率，诊断性能达0.88-0.95 AUC，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NEURAL解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架为胶质母细胞瘤的快速诊断提供了新工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 旨在开发一种更接近人类长期记忆的多模态代理，以提升其在复杂任务中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 提出M3-Agent框架，采用实体中心的多模态记忆组织方式，并通过强化学习训练。开发M3-Bench基准测试评估性能。

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long上分别比基线模型准确率高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%。

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和推理能力方面取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了设计参考。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

Conclusion: R2R方法有效解决了图像协调中的细节保留和光照适应问题，同时公开了代码、数据集和模型权重。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其计算成本高昂，稀疏混合专家架构（MoE）虽能提高参数效率，但在同时建模模态内特征和跨模态关联方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MoIIE架构，通过模态引导的路由机制将令牌分配到模态内专家和共享的跨模态专家池中，并采用两阶段训练策略激活MoE和多模态能力。

Result: 实验表明，MoIIE模型在5.5B和11.3B激活参数下，性能匹配甚至超越现有开源MoE-LLMs多模态模型，且效率更高。

Conclusion: MoIIE为LVLMs提供了一种高效且通用的稀疏架构，显著提升了多模态任务的性能与效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Motivation: 传统方法依赖对齐相同表面，而本研究明确建模互锁形状的两个特性：相同表面形状和相反体积占用。

Method: 通过学习在表面形状相同但体积占用相反的区域建立对应关系，并通过等变神经网络估计形状方向以对齐旋转区域。

Result: 显著减少了匹配中的局部模糊性，实现了部件的稳健组合，在几何装配基准测试中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在几何形状装配中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Motivation: 预训练模型在少样本类增量学习中尚未充分探索，该任务需要从有限样本中持续学习新概念同时不遗忘旧知识。

Method: 结合静态提示（解决预训练与下游任务领域差异）和动态提示（捕获实例感知语义），利用多模态模型生成输入相关的动态提示，并通过原型分类器实现高性能。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DSS-Prompt表现优于现有方法，并缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt通过提示机制有效解决了少样本类增量学习问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

Motivation: 传统基于检测的跟踪方法依赖卡尔曼滤波器和刚性IoU关联，在复杂运动和遮挡场景下表现不佳，导致跟踪错误和目标丢失。

Method: 提出MeMoSORT，包含记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波器（MeKF）补偿运动模型不匹配，以及运动自适应IoU（Mo-IoU）扩展匹配空间并引入高度相似性。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT上分别达到67.9%和82.1%的HOTA分数，表现最优。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT通过创新设计解决了传统方法的不足，实现了高性能的多目标跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

Motivation: 现有SISR方法在PBR材料超分辨率中存在跨图不一致性、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移导致的泛化能力有限问题。

Method: MUJICA是一种灵活的适配器，通过跨图注意力融合特征，同时保留预训练SISR模型的重建能力，可无缝集成到SwinIR等SISR模型中。

Conclusion: MUJICA为PBR材料超分辨率提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型为动态反偷猎提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了感知对齐与鲁棒性的权衡机制，为优化视觉语言模型提供新思路。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Conclusion: ViMoNet通过结合运动和视频数据，显著提升了人类行为理解的性能。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

*Zijian Song,Sihan Qin,Tianshui Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAR利用视频预训练中的世界知识，通过物理令牌结合帧和动作，实现机器人及其环境的联合演化，无需动作预训练即可准确预测视频和一致动作轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人领域缺乏操纵数据，促使研究者利用其他模态的预训练大模型。

Method: 提出物理自回归模型（PAR），结合DiT去令牌化器、因果掩码、逆运动学、并行训练和KV缓存机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill基准测试中，PAR在PushCube任务上达到100%成功率，其他任务表现与动作预训练基线相当，并能准确预测未来视频。

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过视频预训练迁移世界知识在机器人操纵中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### [103] [Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824)
*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的深度反向卷积算子，用于有效逆转深度卷积，并通过实验验证了其在图像恢复任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆操作，目前神经网络中缺乏标准的反向卷积算子，因此需要开发一种有效的反向卷积方法。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题，提出了深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建了反向卷积块。

Result: 实验表明，提出的反向卷积算子作为基础模块在图像去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度模型设计中新算子的开发和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

*Hao Yang,Xu Zhang,Jiaqi Ma,Linwei Zhu,Yun Zhang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过建模视口间的结构关系来提升对空间失真非均匀性的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OIQA方法难以评估局部非均匀失真，因为缺乏对质量空间变化的建模和有效的特征表示。

Method: 使用斐波那契球采样生成视口，将其表示为图节点，结合多阶段特征提取网络和图注意力网络（GAT）及图变换器，捕获局部和全局失真变化。

Result: 在两个大型OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估扩散模型在小规模数据集上的人脸生成性能，并探索如何通过对比学习和先进分割编码提升生成的可控性。

Method: 比较UNet和DiT的无条件生成，采用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion模型，结合InfoNCE损失和SegFormer分割编码器实现多条件生成。

Result: 结果表明对比嵌入学习和先进分割编码在有限数据下提升了人脸生成的语义对齐和可控性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了InfoNCE损失和SegFormer编码器在小规模数据集上提升人脸生成性能的有效性。

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARI3D是一款用于交互式分析X射线CT图像区域的软件工具，旨在改进相位识别、解决部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并统一跨学科的3D定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），导致微观结构定量分析需要用户基于体素灰度值做出大量决策，ARI3D旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 开发ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式分析三维X射线CT图像区域，辅助用户完成分类和量化协议中的各个步骤。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并实现跨学科的3D定量分析标准化。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像的微观结构分析提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，适用于多学科领域。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，Vision Transformers (ViTs) 的模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化会影响其与人类感知的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViTs在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在TID2013数据集上系统分析模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化对ViT感知对齐的影响。

Result: 大模型对齐性更低；增加数据集多样性影响小，重复训练降低对齐性；强数据增强和正则化进一步降低对齐性。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中谨慎选择。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合连续和离散视频VAE的方法OneVAE，通过利用连续VAE的先验知识，显著提升了离散VAE的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE表现更优，因此希望通过结合两者优势来改进离散VAE。

Method: 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验，提出多令牌量化机制和增强首帧重建的结构改进，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: OneVAE训练速度提升数倍，PSNR提高近1 dB，并在高压缩视频VAE中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: OneVAE首次在单一网络中实现了连续和离散表示的性能竞争，为多模态LLM提供了更高效的视频编码方案。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D建模和细节保留上存在不足，且生成能力有限，导致几何不一致和运动泛化问题。

Method: HumanGenesis整合几何与生成建模，包括Reconstructor、Critique Agent、Pose Guider和Video Harmonizer四个代理。

Result: 在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化等任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HumanGenesis通过协作代理显著提升了合成人类动态的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Motivation: 传统RGB相机在光照不足、运动模糊和动态范围有限的情况下表现不佳，而事件相机具有低功耗、高时间分辨率和高动态范围的优势，适合高速运动和低光场景的重建。

Method: 提出事件驱动的初始化方案和事件自适应切片泼溅技术，结合强度重要性修剪和自适应对比度阈值优化，实现时间感知重建。

Result: E-4DGS在合成多视角事件流数据集上表现优于纯事件和事件-RGB融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角事件流重建提供了新思路，适用于快速场景捕捉。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not
present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell

covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model

Result: 提供了HTG方法当前能力的见解，并指出了在低资源HTR应用中需要改进的关键领域。

Conclusion: HTG模型在低资源HTR中有潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并结合高阶ODE求解器，显著加速LDCT去噪推理时间，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）减少辐射但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合中间噪声启动和高阶ODE求解器，减少采样步骤。

Result: AST-25在25步内实现PSNR>38 dB和SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶求解器在临床中可行，快速重建LDCT且保持图像质量。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 探索如何简化视觉上下文学习过程，避免复杂训练和额外数据需求，提高通用性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式结合查询与示例提示的上下文。

Result: 模型在六种视觉任务上表现优异，例如前景分割任务在Pascal-5i数据集上mIoU提升8.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需微调即可高效适应多任务，并通过集成进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

*Yaohui Wang,Di Yang,Xinyuan Chen,Francois Bremond,Yu Qiao,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIA-X是一种新型可解释的肖像动画生成器，通过线性导航潜在空间中的运动代码实现面部动态转移，并支持精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在面部动态转移中缺乏精细控制和可解释性，LIA-X旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自编码器架构，结合稀疏运动字典（Sparse Motion Dictionary）实现面部动态的可解释分解，支持“编辑-变形-渲染”策略。

Result: 在自重现和跨重现任务中表现优于现有方法，支持用户引导的精细图像和视频编辑。

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释性和可控性，为肖像动画和视频编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在自动化营养分析领域的进展因缺乏标准化评估方法和高质量数据集而受限。

Method: 引入JFB数据集、综合评估框架及专用模型january/food-vision-v1，并与通用模型对比。

Result: 专用模型在综合评分上达到86.2，比最佳通用模型高12.1分。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化营养分析提供了新的数据集和评估框架，推动了未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by
the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world
benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions.
First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available
collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we
detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a
novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance
holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model,
january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model
achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the
best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research
community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide
and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

### [118] [MOC: Meta-Optimized Classifier for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09967)
*Tianqi Xiang,Yi Li,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)的新方法，通过元学习和多样分类器组合，显著提升了少样本学习下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言基础模型(VLFMs)的少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: MOC包含一个元学习器和一个分类器库，前者优化分类器配置，后者提供多样候选分类器。

Result: 在TCGA-NSCLC基准测试中，MOC的AUC比现有方法提高了10.4%，在1-shot条件下提升达26.25%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床数据稀缺场景下的WSI分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

*Geonhee Sim,Gyeongsik Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿态丰富视频，扩散方法难以保持身份一致性。PERSONA旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散方法从单张图像生成姿态丰富视频，优化3D化身，引入平衡采样和几何加权优化。

Result: 实现了高真实感和锐利渲染，解决了身份偏移和姿态依赖问题。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像生成3D化身提供高效解决方案，结合了两种方法的优势。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative
to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering
high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel
view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of
downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This
survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS
applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic
understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of
NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS
applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional
tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies,
and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging
trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized,
along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To

TL;DR: LLMC+是一个全面的VLM压缩基准测试工具包，支持20多种算法，揭示了空间和时间冗余需要不同策略，并展示了联合压缩的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VLM压缩方法在公平评估、多任务性能和联合技术应用上的局限性。

Method: 开发LLMC+工具包，支持多种算法，系统性研究token级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，多任务中token压缩性能下降，联合压缩效果显著。

Conclusion: LLMC+为高效VLM研究提供了公平评估平台，并展示了联合压缩的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Story2Board是一个无需训练的框架，用于从自然语言生成富有表现力的故事板。它通过潜在面板锚定和互惠注意力值混合增强一致性，无需架构更改或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注主题身份，忽略了视觉叙事的关键方面（如空间构图、背景演变和叙事节奏）。Story2Board旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：潜在面板锚定（保持角色一致性）和互惠注意力值混合（软融合视觉特征）。使用现成语言模型将故事转换为面板级提示。

Result: 在Rich Storyboard Benchmark上，Story2Board生成的故事板在布局多样性、背景叙事和一致性方面表现优异，并通过用户研究验证了其动态性和叙事吸引力。

Conclusion: Story2Board在无需训练的情况下，显著提升了故事板的动态性、一致性和叙事吸引力，优于现有基线。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

### [123] [ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09303)
*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu,Japinder Singh,Aaditya Shukla,Rama Akkiraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParallelSearch是一种新型强化学习框架，通过并行处理查询提升搜索代理的效率，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索代理在处理并行化查询时存在效率瓶颈，限制了计算性能。

Method: 提出ParallelSearch框架，利用强化学习识别并行化查询结构并执行并发搜索操作。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中平均性能提升2.9%，并行化问题性能提升12.7%，且LLM调用减少30.4%。

Conclusion: ParallelSearch显著提升了搜索代理的效率，尤其在并行化查询任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge
sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by
dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural
limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when
handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This
sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,
particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address
this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement
learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize
parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations
concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that
incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving
answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition
quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average
performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,
on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance
improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential
approaches.

*Nan Miles Xi,Yu Deng,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了GPT-4o在罕见疾病命名实体识别（NER）中的表现，通过多种提示策略（如零样本、少样本、RAG和微调）提升性能，并在低资源环境下取得优于传统模型的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病领域的NER面临标注数据少、语义模糊和长尾分布等挑战，需要探索高效的低资源解决方案。

Method: 设计了结构化提示框架，结合领域知识，并引入语义引导的少样本选择方法，评估了多种提示策略。

Result: GPT-4o在RareDis Corpus上表现优于BioClinicalBERT，微调后达到SOTA；少样本提示在低成本下效果显著。

Conclusion: 提示优化的LLM可作为罕见疾病NER的高效替代方案，尤其在标注数据稀缺时。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the rare disease domain poses unique
challenges due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity between entity
types, and long-tail distributions. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities
of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of
prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We
design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge
and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two
semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context
performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus
show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding new state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting
delivers high returns at low token budgets, while RAG offers marginal
additional benefit. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as
boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing
and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can
serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in
biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data
is scarce.

TL;DR: TEN是一种神经符号方法，用于从半结构化文本中提取表格数据，结合了大型语言模型（LLM）和符号检查器，显著提高了准确性和减少了幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半结构化文本缺乏一致的分隔符，纯神经方法因幻觉和无法强制约束而表现不佳。

Method: TEN使用结构分解提示生成初始表格，符号检查器评估表格质量，并通过自调试循环修正错误。

Result: TEN在多个数据集和指标上显著优于纯神经基线，用户研究显示其表格更准确且更受欢迎。

Conclusion: TEN通过神经符号结合解决了表格提取的挑战，效果显著。

Abstract: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from
semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input
that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows.
Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their
inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition
prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large
language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a
symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but
also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic
checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the
table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely
neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly
higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A
21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated
significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are
consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with
participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经影像成本高且受限，而数字文本为情感-大脑映射提供了新途径。现有研究缺乏将神经影像与文本分析的整合。

Method: 使用OpenAI的文本嵌入模型生成语义表示，通过降维和聚类识别情感组，并映射到18个大脑区域。实验包括健康与抑郁人群对比、GoEmotions数据集分析及人类与AI文本比较。

Result: 结果显示高空间特异性的神经解剖映射，抑郁人群表现出更强的边缘系统激活。AI文本在基础情感分布上与人类相似，但缺乏共情和自我相关区域的激活。

Conclusion: 该方法成本低、可扩展，适用于自然语言的大规模分析，能区分临床群体，并为AI情感表达提供基于大脑的评估标准。

Abstract: Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function
is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text
offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined
neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis
separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that
maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without
requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate
high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and
clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions
linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing
conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to
compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and
iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to
assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored
via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with
high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic
engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully
differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution
but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial
prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable
approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes
between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating
AI emotional expression.

*Cathy Speed,Ahmed A. Metwally*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合人类专家与生成式AI的混合德尔菲框架（HAH-Delphi），用于高效生成高质量共识，并在多个领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共识方法存在高负担、简化解释和忽略条件性细节等问题，信息过载和证据碎片化加剧了这些挑战。

Method: HAH-Delphi整合生成式AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）、小型专家小组和结构化引导，分三个阶段测试：回顾性复制、前瞻性比较和应用部署。

Result: AI在回顾性阶段复制了95%的共识结论，前瞻性阶段与专家方向性一致率达95%；小型专家小组在应用阶段达成>90%共识覆盖。

Conclusion: HAH-Delphi是一种灵活、可扩展的方法，适用于生成高质量、情境敏感的共识，为个性化指导和共识框架提供了基础。

Abstract: Expert consensus plays a critical role in domains where evidence is complex,
conflicting, or insufficient for direct prescription. Traditional methods, such
as Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,
offer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive
oversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are
now exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,
and increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert
filtering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi
(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by
integrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior
human experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three
phases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied
deployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed
cardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus
conclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human
experts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In
Phase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus
coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI
provided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence
resolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a
flexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive
consensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance
science confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a
foundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published
consensus frameworks at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合建模语言和声学信息的文本无关语音生成模型，通过预测语义标记和连续声学帧表示，提升了声学细节的控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本无关语音模型仅预测语义标记，依赖外部声码器生成声学信息，缺乏声学上下文和控制能力。

Method: 使用流匹配目标预测连续声学向量，并研究多未来语义标记预测以保留语言信息。

Result: 在语言似然基准测试中表现与现有模型相当，同时在提示生成中提供更好的声学细节。

Conclusion: 联合建模语言和声学信息的方法有效提升了语音生成的声学控制能力。

Abstract: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that
do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next
semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a
separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such
models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic
details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic
information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued
representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to
predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the
design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic
tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable
performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks,
while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步使得通过简单的基于提示的交互完成多种自然语言处理任务成为可能，但如何优化提示以最大化模型性能仍需研究。

Method: 提出APIO方法，通过自动提示诱导和优化，无需手动指定种子提示，专注于语法错误修正和文本简化任务。

Result: APIO在语法错误修正和文本简化任务上取得了基于LLM的提示方法的最新性能。

Conclusion: APIO是一种简单有效的自动提示优化方法，为LLM在特定任务中的应用提供了新思路，并公开了相关资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range
of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple
prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed
to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task
(e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to
optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have
been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we
propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach
for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification,
without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these
tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.

major limitations, and we introduce 4 new datasets in enterprise/science
domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures
used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new
synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we
develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments
show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most
advanced solution, by 4-29\%, over 5 datasets. Columbo has been used in
production on EDI, a major data portal for environmental sciences.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用Zipformer处理双语（普通话和英语）不平衡的儿童导向场景中的语言识别问题，通过内部层编码语言特征，显著提升了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双语环境中儿童导向场景下语言识别和代码转换的挑战。

Method: 利用Zipformer的内部层编码语言特征，提取嵌入并与不同后端进行比较。

Result: 在数据不平衡情况下，平衡准确率（BAC）达到81.89%，比基线提升15.47%。

Conclusion: Zipformer在语言识别任务中表现出色，展示了其在现实场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Code-switching and language identification in child-directed scenarios
present significant challenges, particularly in bilingual environments. This
paper addresses this challenge by using Zipformer to handle the nuances of
speech, which contains two imbalanced languages, Mandarin and English, in an
utterance. This work demonstrates that the internal layers of the Zipformer
effectively encode the language characteristics, which can be leveraged in
language identification. We present the selection methodology of the inner
layers to extract the embeddings and make a comparison with different
back-ends. Our analysis shows that Zipformer is robust across these backends.
Our approach effectively handles imbalanced data, achieving a Balanced Accuracy
(BAC) of 81.89%, a 15.47% improvement over the language identification
baseline. These findings highlight the potential of the transformer encoder
architecture model in real scenarios.

Motivation: 探索VLMs在图表到文本任务中可能存在的偏见及其社会影响。

Result: 现有VLMs对高收入国家的描述更积极，且不同模型表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: 提示去偏见技术效果有限，需更鲁棒的去偏见策略。

Abstract: Charts are very common for exploring data and communicating insights, but
extracting key takeaways from charts and articulating them in natural language
can be challenging. The chart-to-text task aims to automate this process by
generating textual summaries of charts. While with the rapid advancement of
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we have witnessed great progress in this
domain, little to no attention has been given to potential biases in their
outputs. This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when
generating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we
conduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart
summaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and
open-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the
sentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend
to produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to
middle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only
variable changed. We also find that models such as GPT-4o-mini,
Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Phi-3.5 exhibit varying degrees of bias. We further
explore inference-time prompt-based debiasing techniques using positive
distractors but find them only partially effective, underscoring the complexity
of the issue and the need for more robust debiasing strategies. Our code and
dataset are publicly available here.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个用户中心的主观排行榜（USL），通过偏好驱动的动态排名帮助用户选择适合的大语言模型（LLM），并引入了可定制奖励模型（CRM）以解决人类偏好的多样性和矛盾性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准主要关注可验证任务，对实际用户需求帮助有限，因此需要一种更贴近用户偏好的评估方法。

Method: 基于10K+主观查询的人类偏好数据，开发了可定制奖励模型（CRM），仅需4B参数即可超越GPT-4.1等领先模型。

Result: CRM在泛化能力和处理矛盾偏好方面表现优异，USL显示出与矛盾偏好的强负相关性。

Conclusion: USL和CRM为LLM选择提供了更实用的动态评估工具，显著提升了模型选择的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) predominantely focus on
assessing their capabilities through verifiable tasks. Such objective and
static benchmarks offer limited utility for practical LLM selection, making it
difficult for users to find suitable models for their individual needs. To
bridge this gap, we present the first User-Centric Subjective Leaderboard
(USL), which provides a preference-driven, dynamic ranking of LLMs across
diverse real-world scenarios. Our work is built upon a thorough investigation
of real human preference data, involving more than 10K subjective queries. Our
investigation reveals significant diversity and contradictions in human
preferences, which limit the effectiveness of state-of-the-art reward models.
To address this, we introduce Customizable Reward Models (CRMs). With only 4B
parameters, our CRM surpasses the performance of leading models such as GPT-4.1
and Gemini-2.5-pro, showing exceptional generalization capabilities across new
topics and criteria. The USL, powered by CRMs, exhibits strong negative
correlations to contradictory preferences.

TL;DR: 论文提出Active Reading框架，通过模型自生成学习策略，显著提升知识吸收能力，优于传统微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在学习和记忆知识时不可靠的问题，提供工具确保模型能稳定学习特定知识。

Method: 提出Active Reading框架，训练模型通过自生成策略学习特定材料。

Result: 在专家领域测试中，Active Reading显著优于传统微调，模型在SimpleQA和FinanceBench上表现突出。Meta WikiExpert-8B模型在事实性问答中超越更大规模模型。

Conclusion: Active Reading能有效提升模型知识吸收能力，适用于预训练和微调，为构建更可靠的模型提供新方法。

Abstract: LLMs are known to store vast amounts of knowledge in their parametric memory.
However, learning and recalling facts from this memory is known to be
unreliable, depending largely on the prevalence of particular facts in the
training data and other factors which are poorly understood. Practitioners are
lacking tools which will allow them to ensure that the models learn a given
body of knowledge reliably and consistently. To this end, we propose Active
Reading: a framework where we train models to study a given set of material
with self-generated learning strategies. First, we demonstrate models trained
with Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than
vanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that
achieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over
vanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla
finetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each
benchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training
scale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta
WikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens,
which outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态段落选择器（DPS），用于改进检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的重排序模块，解决了传统固定Top-K方法在多跳查询中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统的重排序模块在处理多跳查询时存在固定Top-K的局限性，无法动态选择相关段落，导致信息遗漏或噪声引入。

Method: DPS将段落选择视为监督学习问题，通过捕捉段落间依赖关系动态选择最相关段落，无需修改标准RAG流程。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DPS表现优于现有重排序方法，尤其在MuSiQue数据集上F1分数提升了30.06%和15.4%。

Conclusion: DPS通过自适应证据选择显著提升了复杂RAG场景下的推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are often bottlenecked by their
reranking modules, which typically score passages independently and select a
fixed Top-K size. This approach struggles with complex multi-hop queries that
require synthesizing evidence across multiple documents, creating a trade-off
where small K values omit crucial information and large K values introduce
noise. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a
novel reranking framework that treats passage selection as a supervised
learning problem. Unlike traditional point-wise or list-wise methods, DPS is
fine-tuned to capture inter-passage dependencies and dynamically select the
most relevant set of passages for generation. As a seamless plug-and-play
module, DPS requires no modifications to the standard RAG pipeline.
Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that DPS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers and fine-tuning methods. Notably, on the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, DPS improves the F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% over
strong baselines like Qwen3-reranker and RankingGPT, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that by enabling adaptive evidence selection, DPS substantially
enhances reasoning capabilities in complex RAG scenarios.

Result: 在六种语言和五种骨干模型上验证了方法的有效性，超越了基于翻译的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅支持生成模型，且微调后的LLM优于小型多语言模型。

Abstract: Cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves detailed
sentiment analysis in a target language by transferring knowledge from a source
language with available annotated data. Most existing methods depend heavily on
often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper,
we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to
generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the
need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain
predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to
generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than
the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting
pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across
six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative
models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual
models.

Result: 综述了现有研究成果，并分析了单语言、多语言ABSA及大语言模型对跨语言ABSA的贡献。

Conclusion: 提出了跨语言ABSA的主要挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that focuses on understanding opinions at the aspect level, including
sentiment towards specific aspect terms, categories, and opinions. While ABSA
research has seen significant progress, much of the focus has been on
monolingual settings. Cross-lingual ABSA, which aims to transfer knowledge from
resource-rich languages (such as English) to low-resource languages, remains an
under-explored area, with no systematic review of the field. This paper aims to
fill that gap by providing a comprehensive survey of cross-lingual ABSA. We
summarize key ABSA tasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment
classification, and compound tasks involving multiple sentiment elements.
Additionally, we review the datasets, modelling paradigms, and cross-lingual
transfer methods used to solve these tasks. We also examine how existing work
in monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to
the development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main
challenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual
ABSA systems.

Our approach achieved 7th place in monolingual and 9th in cross-lingual
subtasks. We used only English translations as an input to the text embedding
models since multilingual models did not achieve satisfactory results. We
identified the most relevant claims for each post by leveraging the embeddings
and measuring cosine similarity. Overall, the best results were obtained by the

Result: 显著提升了模型的情感支持能力，推动了共情化、人性化支持系统的发展。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了共情推理不足和响应重复性问题，为情感支持系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emotional support conversations are crucial for promoting emotional
well-being, yet current models often lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in
psychological principles. To address this, we propose controllable empathetic
reasoning, which combines natural language reasoning with structured
psychological steps. We construct a fine-grained dataset annotated with
reasoning correctness and response preferences to enable this capability. To
further enhance training, we employ reinforcement learning with a unified
process-outcome reward model that delivers precise feedback. To mitigate
response repetitiveness from entropy collapse, we introduce personality-based
dialogue rewriting and a redundancy-aware reward reweighting strategy. Our
approach significantly improves model's emotional support ability, advancing
the development of empathetic, human-like support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法需要访问模型的隐藏状态或概率分布，限制了其在仅API访问模型（如GPT-4）中的应用。

Method: 利用模型更易记忆训练数据中常见文本模式的特性，通过n-gram重叠度量计算模型输出与候选成员后缀的相似性，预测成员资格。

Result: 在多种基准测试中表现优异，攻击性能随计算预算增加而提升。最新模型（如GPT-4o）对成员推理的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: N-Gram Coverage Attack为黑盒模型成员推理提供了有效工具，同时发现模型隐私保护能力在逐步提升。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language
models, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data
leakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to
models' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation
into more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we
introduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies
solely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely
black-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to
memorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in
their training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,
N-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on
a prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and
aggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high
similarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set
of existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box
methods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance
to state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text
outputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with
the attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated
from the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to
improve. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate
previously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that
more recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership
inference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections.

particularly in scientific publishing and multilingual contexts where detection
resources are often limited. To address this critical gap, we introduce the

AI-generated scientific abstracts in Russian. We present a novel, large-scale
dataset comprising 52,305 samples, including human-written abstracts across 12
diverse scientific domains and AI-generated counterparts from five
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Gemma2-27B, Llama3.3-70B, Deepseek-V3, and
GigaChat-Lite). A core objective of the task is to challenge participants to
develop robust solutions capable of generalizing to both (i) previously unseen
scientific domains and (ii) models not included in the training data. The task
was organized in two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions, with top
systems demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content.
We also establish a continuous shared task platform to foster ongoing research

Motivation: 研究如何通过温度调整优化语言模型的多样性与性能，发现传统方法存在局限性，需改进损失函数设计。

Method: 通过分析温度调整对模型性能的影响，提出基于精确度-召回率框架的损失函数设计方法。

Result: 新方法在精确度与召回率之间实现了更好的平衡，优于传统的负对数似然训练结合温度缩放。

Conclusion: 重新设计损失函数可为语言模型提供更优的性能调优路径，提升其多样性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential
objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this
work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to
provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality
(Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our
analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature
adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose
rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall
framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially
better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative
log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a
pathway toward more versatile and robust language modeling techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the development of
increasingly large and diverse evaluation benchmarks have introduced
substantial computational challenges for model assessment. In this paper, we
present EffiEval, a training-free approach for efficient benchmarking that
effectively addresses data redundancy while maintaining high evaluation
reliability. Our method is specifically designed to meet three key criteria for
high-quality evaluation: representativeness, by ensuring comprehensive coverage
of model capabilities; fairness, by remaining independent of model performance
during sample selection to avoid bias; and generalizability, by enabling
flexible transfer across datasets and model families without reliance on
large-scale evaluation data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on absolute
performance or require extensive evaluation data, our approach adaptively
selects high-quality representative subsets based on the Model Utility Index
(MUI). Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks and diverse LLMs
demonstrate that EffiEval achieves strong ranking consistency with full-dataset
evaluation using only a small fraction of the original data. Furthermore, our
method is flexible and scalable in size, allowing users to balance evaluation
efficiency and representativeness according to specific needs. Overall,
EffiEval provides a practical and generalizable solution for reliable, fair,
and efficient evaluation in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法虽能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但忽视了其对模型安全性的负面影响，且现有安全对齐方法需额外计算或标注数据，可能影响推理能力。

Method: 提出SLowED方法，包含Slow Tuning（缩小权重变化幅度）和Low-Entropy Masking（屏蔽低熵词）两个模块。

Result: 在多个推理基准和安全评估中，SLowED在保持安全性的同时提升了推理能力，且消融实验验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: SLowED是一种高效的安全蒸馏方法，平衡了推理能力与安全性。

Abstract: Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by
utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4). However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM
safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although
there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or
manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra
computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of
SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during
the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation
method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing
two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the
magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the
neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking
masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,
to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,
Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,
AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety
of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing
distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the
effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former
maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the
safe training epochs.

of a junior lawyer, with advanced law students rating the work on helpfulness,
accuracy, and comprehensiveness. LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting,
often matching or surpassing human work. However, they struggle with
specialised legal research, frequently generating hallucinations, factually
incorrect or fabricated outputs. I conclude that while LLMs can augment certain
legal tasks, human expertise remains essential for nuanced reasoning and the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）容易被误导性可视化设计欺骗，导致对图表的错误解读，需加强防范措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在面对误导性可视化设计时的表现，揭示其易受欺骗的问题。

Method: 评估10种不同VLMs对8类误导性图表设计的16,000余次响应。

Result: 多数VLMs被误导性设计欺骗，导致对相同数据的错误解读。

Conclusion: 需在VLMs中引入更强防护机制，防止视觉误导信息的传播。

Abstract: Information visualizations are powerful tools that help users quickly
identify patterns, trends, and outliers, facilitating informed decision-making.
However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements-such as
truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best
practices-they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading
misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly
manipulate perception while maintaining a facade of legitimacy. As
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret
visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand
how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we
conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading
visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000 responses from ten different models
across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that
most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of
charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same. Our findings highlight
the need for robust safeguards in VLMs against visual misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GFPO通过训练时采样更多组并基于长度和令牌效率过滤响应，减少语言模型因追求准确性而导致的长度膨胀，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习中倾向于通过增加回答长度来提高准确性，导致许多冗余内容。GFPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GFPO在训练时采样更大组别，并根据响应长度和令牌效率（奖励与令牌比）过滤响应进行训练。还提出自适应难度GFPO动态分配资源。

Result: 在Phi-4-reasoning模型上，GFPO将长度膨胀减少46-85%，同时保持准确性。自适应难度GFPO进一步优化资源分配。

Conclusion: GFPO证明增加训练计算可直接减少测试计算，是一种高效推理的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to
achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder
problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes
no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which
curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during
training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1)
response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling
more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the
Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across
challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH,
LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token
further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose
Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources
to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the
balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult
questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly
translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for
efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多跳问答的新型检索增强生成（RAG）框架，通过分解问题和生成可回答问题提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多跳问答中查询模糊和文档检索效率低的问题。

Method: 1. 使用LLM分解多跳问题为单跳子问题；2. 生成可回答问题并嵌入，通过问题-问题相似性检索文档块。

Result: 在三个多跳问答数据集上表现优于基线系统。

Conclusion: 可回答问题嵌入和LLM查询分解在多跳RAG中效果显著。

Abstract: We introduce a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored
for multihop question answering. First, our system uses large language model
(LLM) to decompose complex multihop questions into a sequence of single-hop
subquestions that guide document retrieval. This decomposition mitigates the
ambiguity inherent in multi-hop queries by clearly targeting distinct knowledge
facets. Second, instead of embedding raw or chunked documents directly, we
generate answerable questions from each document chunk using Qwen3-8B, embed
these generated questions, and retrieve relevant chunks via question-question
embedding similarity. During inference, the retrieved chunks are then fed along
with the original question into the RAG pipeline. We evaluate on three multihop
question datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQa, HotpotQA) from LongBench. Our
method improves RAG performacne compared to baseline systems. Our contributions
highlight the benefits of using answerable-question embeddings for RAG, and the
effectiveness of LLM-based query decomposition for multihop scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在政治话题上的立场受提示内容影响显著，支持或反驳的论点会大幅改变模型响应，且论点强度影响模型的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示内容对LLMs政治偏见评估的影响，以理解模型行为及偏见评估的稳健性。

Method: 在支持与反驳论点存在的情况下进行政治偏见实验，分析单轮和多轮对话中模型的响应变化。

Result: 论点显著改变模型响应方向，论点强度影响模型的一致性，表明LLMs存在迎合倾向。

Conclusion: 提示内容对LLMs政治偏见评估有重要影响，需开发更有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: There have been numerous studies evaluating bias of LLMs towards political
topics. However, how positions towards these topics in model outputs are highly
sensitive to the prompt. What happens when the prompt itself is suggestive of
certain arguments towards those positions remains underexplored. This is
crucial for understanding how robust these bias evaluations are and for
understanding model behaviour, as these models frequently interact with
opinionated text. To that end, we conduct experiments for political bias
evaluation in presence of supporting and refuting arguments. Our experiments
show that such arguments substantially alter model responses towards the
direction of the provided argument in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.
Moreover, we find that the strength of these arguments influences the
directional agreement rate of model responses. These effects point to a
sycophantic tendency in LLMs adapting their stance to align with the presented
arguments which has downstream implications for measuring political bias and
developing effective mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: UtterTune是一种轻量级适应方法，通过低秩适应调整基于LLM的多语言TTS系统，提升目标语言（日语）的发音可控性，同时保持其他语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM架构的TTS模型在自然度上表现优异，但在G2P映射和韵律建模上仍有挑战，尤其是缺少显式G2P模块时。UtterTune旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，针对日语语音在音素级别控制发音和音高重音，同时保持零样本设置下的自然度和说话人相似性。

Result: 主客观评估证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: UtterTune成功提升了目标语言的发音可控性，同时不影响其他语言的性能。

Abstract: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a
multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM)
architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a
target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures
have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially
when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally
encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank
adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at
the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while
maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting.
Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing
(NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for
explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels.
Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly,
labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated
framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality
of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural
Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream
impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse
benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations
exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated
explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a
promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation
generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更清晰的定义和用户中心框架，以促进可解释性NLP的实际应用。

Abstract: The field of explainable natural language processing (NLP) has grown rapidly
in recent years. The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency
and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their
reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments.
Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners'
perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain
underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating
practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing
on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed,
satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP
applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry
practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we
systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal
conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and
highlight evaluation challenges. Our findings emphasize the need for clear
definitions and user-centric frameworks for better adoption of explainable NLP
in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解上表现不佳，主要因为训练数据缺乏多样性和真实性，以及依赖低质量数据集的监督微调。

Method: 提出BigCharts数据集生成流程，结合真实图表数据；并设计包含监督微调和GRPO强化学习的训练框架。

Result: BigCharts-R1模型在多个图表问答基准测试中超越现有方法，包括更大规模的开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: BigCharts通过高质量数据和强化学习显著提升了图表理解模型的性能，成为当前最先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Charts are essential to data analysis, transforming raw data into clear
visual representations that support human decision-making. Although current
vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress, they continue to
struggle with chart comprehension due to training on datasets that lack
diversity and real-world authenticity, or on automatically extracted underlying
data tables of charts, which can contain numerous estimation errors.
Furthermore, existing models only rely on supervised fine-tuning using these
low-quality datasets, severely limiting their effectiveness. To address these
issues, we first propose BigCharts, a dataset creation pipeline that generates
visually diverse chart images by conditioning the rendering process on
real-world charts sourced from multiple online platforms. Unlike purely
synthetic datasets, BigCharts incorporates real-world data, ensuring
authenticity and visual diversity, while still retaining accurate underlying
data due to our proposed replotting process. Additionally, we introduce a
comprehensive training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning. By
introducing novel reward signals specifically designed for chart reasoning, our
approach enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse chart
styles and domains, resulting in a state-of-the-art chart reasoning model,
BigCharts-R1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models surpass
existing methods on multiple chart question-answering benchmarks compared to
even larger open-source and closed-source models.

Motivation: 全球心理健康问题日益严重，但专业临床医生资源不足，AI辅助成为潜在解决方案，但高质量数据集是关键。

Method: 对临床心理健康数据集进行全面调查，按疾病、数据类型、任务、可访问性和文化背景分类，并分析合成数据。

Abstract: Mental health disorders are rising worldwide. However, the availability of
trained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without
adequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the
promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,
monitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,
and ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality
clinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for
training clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,
under-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,
comparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental
health care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of
clinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of
AI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental
disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,
speech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom
severity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,
restricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural
background). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental
health datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of
longitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent
collection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic
data. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing
future datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the
development of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI
systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language
understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of
multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer
a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional
transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses
significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In
this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures
that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency.
Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and
technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient
full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures
incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally,
we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider
their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation
models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey
presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this
could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI
systems.

Motivation: 现有基准对长文本理解和深度推理的评估不足，PRELUDE旨在填补这一空白，通过更具挑战性的任务推动模型进步。

Method: 提出PRELUDE基准，要求模型判断角色前传故事的合理性，实验采用上下文学习、RAG和商业服务等方法。

Result: 现有方法表现落后人类15%以上，模型推理准确率差距超过30%，显示长文本理解和推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: PRELUDE揭示了长文本理解和推理的挑战，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding
through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is
consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a
stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing
benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing
their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information
that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence
from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the
challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with
state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans
by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct
answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy
compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for
improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

Motivation: 乌尔都语是全球第十大语言，但自动语音识别（ASR）系统对其支持有限，主要因方言多样性、语码转换和训练数据稀疏。

Method: 在未微调的情况下，使用词错误率（WER）对Whisper模型在乌尔都语数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: Whisper-Small的WER最低（33.68%），优于Tiny（67.08%）和Base（53.67%），但在语音准确性和词汇连贯性上仍有问题。

Conclusion: Whisper-Small展现了乌尔都语ASR的潜力，但仍需进一步研究以解决低资源环境下的挑战。

Abstract: This study evaluates the feasibility of lightweight Whisper models (Tiny,
Base, Small) for Urdu speech recognition in low-resource settings. Despite Urdu
being the 10th most spoken language globally with over 230 million speakers,
its representation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems remains
limited due to dialectal diversity, code-switching, and sparse training data.
We benchmark these models on a curated Urdu dataset using word error rate
(WER), without fine-tuning. Results show Whisper-Small achieves the lowest
error rates (33.68\% WER), outperforming Tiny (67.08\% WER) and Base (53.67\%
WER). Qualitative analysis reveals persistent challenges in phonetic accuracy
and lexical coherence, particularly for complex utterances. While Whisper-Small
demonstrates promise for deployable Urdu ASR, significant gaps remain. Our
findings emphasize lay the groundwork for future research into effective,
low-resource ASR systems.

Result: 实验表明，Memory Decoder在生物医学、金融和法律领域平均降低困惑度6.17点。

Conclusion: Memory Decoder为领域适配提供了高效、通用的新范式，可提升多种模型在目标领域的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language
tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current
method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter
training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency
due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper
introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables
efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters.
Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the
behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder
can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the
same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results
demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen
and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance,
and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory
Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory
component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can
be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance
across multiple models within the target domain.

Conclusion: 结论指出理论与实际应用间的差距，强调需要更强的自动文本识别系统以应对AI与人类交流的复杂性。

Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive
discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This
inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical
studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how
deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings,
detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as
personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is
also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data,
and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there
has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those
empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification
systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and
safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment
approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction
tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each
with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified
evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these
paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a
multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive
evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major
alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:
alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and
robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment
strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying
strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing
valuable insights for future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态输入生成代码方面能力有限，需要提升其视觉与编码的结合能力。

Result: VisCodex在开源MLLMs中达到最先进性能，接近GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VisCodex通过模型合并策略和新数据集，有效提升了多模态代码生成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the
integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to
generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we
introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and
coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation
abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate
a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while
preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support
training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a
large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML
code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic
problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging
benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world
programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and
visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary
models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging
strategy and new datasets.

Motivation: 探索分词器（tokenizer）对语言模型在放射学文本生成质量中的影响，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 系统比较通用、医学和领域特定分词器在三种成像模态的放射学报告摘要任务中的表现，并研究有无预训练的影响。

Result: 领域特定分词器在从头训练时表现最佳，预训练可部分缓解分词器间的性能差异，同时领域特定分词器减少内存需求。

Conclusion: 适应临床领域的词汇表可提升语言模型性能并降低计算需求，使其更适用于研究和实际医疗场景。

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -
plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains
under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by
systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on
the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We
also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed
abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific
vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models
are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance
differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve
the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory
requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results
demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides
practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational
demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and
real-world healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析具有内在模糊性，传统方法忽略上下文缺失可能是模糊性来源。

Method: 通过自动生成基于不同情感的事件链，结合短故事生成技术，构建上下文丰富的叙事。

Result: 上下文叙事增强了特定情感的解释，并提高了标注一致性。

Conclusion: 上下文信息能有效提升情感分析的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Emotion analysis is an inherently ambiguous task. Previous work studied
annotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the
possibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context
of events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable
contexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular
situation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable
human annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target
event description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned
on differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in
various settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized
dataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of
contextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we
find that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions
and support annotators in producing more consistent annotations.

Method: 测试12种GPT-5配置，比较准确性、成本及推理质量。

Result: GPT-5-high准确性最高，但成本较高；GPT-5-mini-low在成本与性能间表现最佳。

Conclusion: GPT-5在眼科任务中表现优异，推理努力影响准确性，并提出了可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5 integrate advanced reasoning
capabilities that may improve performance on complex medical question-answering
tasks. For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that
maximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We
evaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across
four reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using
260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of
Ophthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome
was multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking
via a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a
reference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of
accuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved
the highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano
variants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high
(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x
stronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).
Cost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto
frontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,
high-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality
ophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on
accuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of
LLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: 该研究旨在为库尔德语Badini方言开发语音转文本（STT）系统，填补现有技术空白。通过使用Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53和Whisper-small模型，实验表明前者在准确性和可读性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Badini方言缺乏STT系统，限制了其社区对技术的使用和全球可见性。研究试图通过开发语言模型解决这一问题。

Method: 选择Badini儿童故事作为文本输入，进行录音、清理、分段和标记化处理，使用Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53和Whisper-small模型开发语言模型。

Result: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53模型表现更优，可读性为90.38%，准确性为82.67%，而Whisper-small模型分别为65.45%和53.17%。

Conclusion: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53模型更适合Badini方言的STT系统开发，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are
available in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although
Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,
SST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani
(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,
Badini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this
gap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help
their community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their
dialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on
Badini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,
have a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready
transcriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78
stories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted
in approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized
the input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including
19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and
Whisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the
transcriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a
significantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,
with 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,
respectively.

Result: 在电信问答和医疗诊断数据集上验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法能高效选择LLM序列，优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety
of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict
which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This
problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft
allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular
types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized
and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often
benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can
then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.
For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first
select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,
and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from
the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,
this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of
each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,
unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly
affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,
creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted
for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm
that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online
manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,
even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on
telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM
selection algorithms.

Abstract: One of the most critical features for the successful operation of autonomous
UAVs is the ability to make decisions based on the information acquired from
their surroundings. Each UAV must be able to make decisions during the flight
in order to deal with uncertainties in its system and the environment, and to
further act upon the information being received. Such decisions influence the
future behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,
decision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying
autonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of
existing studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,
presenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative
Path Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled
and understood. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges for relevant
topics in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架通过理论校准保证和实际评估，显著提升了安全预测的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical
challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and
distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited
in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while
model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction
in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition
model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of
world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to
forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the
probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic
and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to
quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from
high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator
can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding
prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to
miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised
domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution
shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides
theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across
long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that
our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower
false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based
composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon
tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.

Conclusion: 结构化奖励框架有效简化了RL训练过程，同时提升了策略的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in generating robust locomotion
policies for bipedal robots, but often suffers from tedious reward design and
sensitivity to poorly shaped objectives. In this work, we propose a structured
reward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and
control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning. We explore two
model-based planners for generating reference trajectories: a reduced-order
linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for velocity-conditioned motion planning,
and a precomputed gait library based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) using
full-order dynamics. These planners define desired end-effector and joint
trajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize
tracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides
meaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a
reference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are
used only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We
validate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world
experiments on a Unitree G1 robot. CLF-RL demonstrates significantly improved
robustness relative to the baseline RL policy and better performance than a
classic tracking reward RL formulation.

Method: 采用条件扩散策略统一两阶段任务，结合DAgger进行在线训练和专家轨迹增强。

Result: 实验表明，DifNav在导航性能上显著优于现有两阶段模型。

Conclusion: DifNav通过端到端优化和扩散策略，有效提升了VLN-CE任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中表现优异，轮廓误差和机器人加速度均较低，性能优于现有方法10倍。

Conclusion: RMPCC框架在动态环境中高效解决了路径跟踪问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive
Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles,
singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many
path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle
collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other
constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual
position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper
derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and
performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic
environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm
that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low
contouring error and low robot acceleration.

Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying
currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned
Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need
to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid
collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting
ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called
Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents
(SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic
environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time
cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of
SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV
performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents
to successfully reach the goal.

Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) is one of the key challenges in
multi-robot systems (MRSs) and has broad applications across various fields.
This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory
planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key
strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for
duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance
of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT
1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to
baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict
scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high
solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline
methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging
configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP,
further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical
robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to
enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially
available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited
workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the
human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale
kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm
as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while
providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel
admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to
render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances.
Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations,
including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its
control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality
applications.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there
is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional
robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize
predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language
understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural
language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions
by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular
integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as
person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series
of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in
real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of
approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

Abstract: Agile flight for the quadrotor cable-suspended payload system is a formidable
challenge due to its underactuated, highly nonlinear, and hybrid dynamics.
Traditional optimization-based methods often struggle with high computational
costs and the complexities of cable mode transitions, limiting their real-time
applicability and maneuverability exploitation. In this letter, we present
FLARE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly learns agile
navigation policy from high-fidelity simulation. Our method is validated across
three designed challenging scenarios, notably outperforming a state-of-the-art
optimization-based approach by a 3x speedup during gate traversal maneuvers.
Furthermore, the learned policies achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real
transfer, demonstrating remarkable agility and safety in real-world
experiments, running in real time on an onboard computer.

Motivation: 为了实现机器人像人类一样的精细操作，需要理解机械顺应性、多模态传感和有目的的交互如何共同塑造触觉感知。

Method: 使用模块化电子皮肤（e-Skin）和一组软波对象，探索多种触诊动作，并提出了一个无监督的动作条件深度状态空间模型（潜在滤波器）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了机械特性和交互策略对触觉感知的重要性，并提供了可推广和可解释的表示方法。

Abstract: To enable robots to develop human-like fine manipulation, it is essential to
understand how mechanical compliance, multi-modal sensing, and purposeful
interaction jointly shape tactile perception. In this study, we use a dedicated
modular e-Skin with tunable mechanical compliance and multi-modal sensing
(normal, shear forces and vibrations) to systematically investigate how sensing
embodiment and interaction strategies influence robotic perception of objects.
Leveraging a curated set of soft wave objects with controlled viscoelastic and
surface properties, we explore a rich set of palpation primitives-pressing,
precession, sliding that vary indentation depth, frequency, and directionality.
In addition, we propose the latent filter, an unsupervised, action-conditioned
deep state-space model of the sophisticated interaction dynamics and infer
causal mechanical properties into a structured latent space. This provides
generalizable and in-depth interpretable representation of how embodiment and
interaction determine and influence perception. Our investigation demonstrates
that multi-modal sensing outperforms uni-modal sensing. It highlights a nuanced
interaction between the environment and mechanical properties of e-Skin, which
should be examined alongside the interaction by incorporating temporal
dynamics.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态遥操作的性能和操作者对任务的专注度。

Abstract: This paper presents an object-aware whole-body bilateral teleoperation
framework for wheeled humanoid loco-manipulation. This framework combines
whole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial
parameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this
work. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object
size estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language
model (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size
estimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial
parameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based
refinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy
first estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size
to ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis
scheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in
parallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online
updates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled
humanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion
and manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for
dynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By
compensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework
also improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We
validate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and
human-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,
delivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third
of the robot's body weight.

Conclusion: 该方法为人机交接任务提供了新表征，提升了协作的流畅性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human
and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such
as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,
real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the
physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective
alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace
remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,
focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need
for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable
the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while
avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages
sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes
to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a
camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose
changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose
changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and
real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method
serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover
task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: Exoskeletons have been shown to effectively assist humans during steady
locomotion. However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by
nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently
explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank
angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time
coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically
shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns
across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists
of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward
control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model
with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU
measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to
inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking
control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a
feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the
lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three
experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple
subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method,
demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations
across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and
physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical
assistance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在狭窄空间中表现出更敏捷的运动能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了腿式机器人在无外部传感器情况下的狭窄空间运动能力。

Abstract: The legged locomotion in spatially constrained structures (called crawl
spaces) is challenging. In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion
learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in
possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion
learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground
features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive
locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is
proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's
surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states
using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in
polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to
efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise
the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that
guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed.
Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits
more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of
legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring
exteroceptive sensors.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental
fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal
across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized
Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed
to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from
human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an
adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically
retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our
novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,
high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire
framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac
Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple
configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training
policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent
performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first
practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid
controllers.

Motivation: 在密集河流环境中，GPS信号不可靠，视觉驱动的无人机自主河流跟踪对救援、监视和环境监测等应用至关重要。

Method: 1. 引入边际增益优势估计（MGAE）优化奖励优势函数；2. 开发基于语义掩码的语义动态模型（SDM）；3. 提出约束演员动态估计器（CADE）架构，结合模型与安全强化学习。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MGAE比传统方法收敛更快且性能更优；SDM提供了更准确的短期状态预测；CADE有效整合了安全约束。

Conclusion: 该方法通过软硬结合的策略平衡了奖励与安全性，为部分可观测约束子模马尔可夫决策过程提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.

Result: 在三个未见过的厨房任务中，Masquerade性能优于基线5-6倍。

Conclusion: 通过缩小视觉体现差距，人类视频成为提升机器人策略的宝贵数据源。

Abstract: Robot manipulation research still suffers from significant data scarcity:
even the largest robot datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less
diverse than those that fueled recent breakthroughs in language and vision. We
introduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos
to bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a
robot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into
robotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the
human arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the
recovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict
future 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing
that auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot
demonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better
than prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in
three unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations
show that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and
performance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These
results demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a
vast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to
improve robot policies.
