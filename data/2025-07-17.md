### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致内存访问不规则，影响硬件效率。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 1. 提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的方法，通过新的切片策略自动划分输入特征为均匀块，避免内存冲突；2. 设计FPGA验证系统。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率，适用于边缘计算部署。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DDCN的新方法，用于高效且准确的时空交通预测，解决了传统GNN和CNN的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和扩展性方面存在不足，尤其是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以处理大规模数据。

Method: DDCN采用动态可变形卷积网络，通过分解为编码器-解码器结构，并结合空间和时空注意力块，动态调整滤波器。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN性能优越，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN通过动态可变形卷积和注意力机制，实现了高效且准确的交通预测，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Inversion-DPO的新型对齐框架，通过DDIM反演优化扩散模型，避免了奖励建模的计算开销，显著提升了训练效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要计算密集型训练，可能导致模型精度和效率下降，因此需要一种更高效、精确的对齐方法。

Method: 通过DDIM反演将Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）应用于扩散模型，避免了奖励建模的需求，并改进了后验采样。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中，Inversion-DPO表现优于现有方法，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂现实生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM是一个新颖的框架，通过重新编程视觉基础模型（VFMs）来解决时空预测任务中的挑战，包括时间建模能力和模态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但在时空预测中，大型语言模型（LLMs）难以捕捉丰富的时空相关性。因此，需要一种新的方法来利用VFMs的强大空间先验。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重编程阶段处理这些输入。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，且兼容多种VFM主干。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN提出了一种多生成器GAN模型，用于水下图像恢复，通过多个专家生成器分别处理不同质量范围的图像，并通过判别器选择最佳恢复结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单生成器GAN模型难以处理水下图像恢复中的复杂退化问题，因此需要一种能够覆盖多种退化范围的模型。

Method: xOp-GAN采用多个专家生成器，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，并通过判别器选择最佳结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器和判别器的协同工作，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过元分析和实验研究，评估了基于步态估计年龄的方法，发现多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），并分析了步态特征与年龄的相关性。深度学习模型表现最佳，准确率达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有研究缺乏系统性能基准和实用指南。

Method: 结合元分析（59项研究）和大规模实验（OU-ISIR和VersatileGait数据集），使用CNN、SVM等方法，并通过Grad-CAM解释模型关注区域。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），CNN准确率达96%，步态特征与年龄相关性显著（相关系数≥0.27）。

Conclusion: 通过综合方法，论文为实际场景中步态年龄估计提供了性能基准和实用指南，目标误差低于3年。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

### [7] [What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575)
*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的PPGNet模型（PPGNet-Cat），用于通过相机陷阱图像识别野生野猫个体，取得了高精度（mAP 0.86，rank-1准确率0.95）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野猫对澳大利亚野生动物造成严重威胁，需要有效监控以减少其影响。

Method: 改进PPGNet模型（原用于阿穆尔虎识别），使其适用于野猫图像，并探索对比学习方法如ArcFace损失。

Result: PPGNet-Cat表现优异，mAP达0.86，rank-1准确率为0.95。

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat是一种高效的野猫重识别模型，适用于监控工作。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

### [8] [SketchDNN: Joint Continuous-Discrete Diffusion for CAD Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11579)
*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN提出了一种生成CAD草图的模型，通过统一的连续-离散扩散过程联合建模连续参数和离散类别标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CAD草图中原始参数化的异质性和原始元素的排列不变性问题。

Method: 采用Gaussian-Softmax扩散，通过高斯噪声扰动logits并通过softmax变换投影到概率单纯形上。

Result: 生成质量显著提升，FID从16.04降至7.80，NLL从84.8降至81.33。

Conclusion: 在SketchGraphs数据集上实现了CAD草图生成的最新成果。

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

### [9] [Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638)
*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的特征编码模型，用于提高直肠癌淋巴结转移（LNM）分期的准确性，替代了传统基于CNN的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于淋巴结大小、形状和纹理的放射学标准诊断准确性有限，VAE因其生成模型特性可直接编码视觉特征，形成更可解释的潜在空间。

Method: 使用VAE作为特征编码器，结合MLP分类器，在168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集上验证。

Result: 提出的VAE-MLP模型在MRI数据集上表现优异，交叉验证指标为AUC 0.86、敏感性0.79、特异性0.85。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在淋巴结转移分期中实现了最先进的性能，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于姿势的心理状态推断方法，通过板球运动验证其有效性，解决了敏感数据收集的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用姿势推断心理状态在疲劳诊断、伤害预防和性能提升方面潜力巨大，但面临敏感数据收集的挑战。

Method: 以板球运动为场景，通过运动分析从活动视频中识别人类意图，并利用现有数据统计作为弱监督。

Result: 方法在区分攻击性和防御性击球意图时，F1分数超过75%，AUC-ROC超过80%。

Conclusion: 姿势分析为意图推断提供了强信号，弱监督方法为数据标注限制提供了解决方案，推动了体育分析和行为分析的通用技术。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [11] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新颖的全局定位框架，通过对象分割和几何一致性实现跨视角和季节变化的鲁棒定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中因视角变化、季节变化等因素导致的定位挑战。

Method: 结合对象分割跟踪和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜视角数据集上召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA无需领域特定训练即可实现高效、实时的全局定位。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

*Maciej Szankin,Vidhyananth Venkatasamy,Lihang Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别的准确性在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法难以应对多变的环境和视觉噪声，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统性地对比了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与轻量级CNN-based OCR（PaddleOCRv4）在两个公开数据集（ICDAR 2015和SVT）上的表现，并加入了合成天气失真以模拟真实场景。

Result: 结果显示，VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 为促进未来研究，作者公开了天气增强的基准数据集和评估代码，强调了计算成本在边缘部署中的重要性。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

### [13] [Beyond Task-Specific Reasoning: A Unified Conditional Generative Framework for Abstract Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11761)
*Fan Shi,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的生成式求解器（UCGS），用于解决多种抽象视觉推理任务，避免了任务特定设计和参数调整的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度抽象视觉推理方法需要针对不同任务重新训练或调整模型的问题。

Method: 将抽象视觉推理任务重新定义为目标图像可预测性问题，并训练一个统一的生成式模型。

Result: UCGS通过多任务训练展示了跨任务的抽象推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS为抽象视觉推理提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

TL;DR: CorrMoE是一种新的对应关系修剪框架，通过去风格化双分支和双融合专家混合模块，提升了跨域和跨场景变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在密集对应关系集中剔除异常点时，通常假设视觉域一致，忽略了多样场景结构带来的挑战。

Method: 提出De-stylization Dual Branch处理域偏移，通过风格混合减少域特定表示的影响；设计Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts模块自适应整合多视角特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CorrMoE表现出优于现有方法的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrMoE通过创新模块设计，有效解决了跨域和跨场景的对应关系修剪问题。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: ProtoConNet通过整合上下文信息和优化原型对齐，显著提升了小样本开放集分类的性能。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

Conclusion: GRACE通过细粒度跨模态对齐和情感感知文本增强，显著提升了动态面部表情识别的准确性。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

*Linwei Chen,Ying Fu,Lin Gu,Dezhi Zheng,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征到低频以避免下采样中的失真，并在上采样时恢复高频信息，显著提升了语义分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息（如纹理）对语义分割准确性至关重要，但在下采样过程中容易因混叠或失真而丢失。

Method: 通过自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征到低频，设计轻量级模块密集采样高频区域；提出多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）恢复高频信息。

Result: 方法有效减轻了混叠并保留了细节，适用于多种任务（如图像分类、实例分割等）。

Conclusion: SFM方法在多种架构中无缝集成，广泛适用于不同任务，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 事件传感器在行人监测中表现优异，但相关数据稀缺，SEPose旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成合成数据，包含多种环境和条件下的行人姿态。

Result: SEPose包含近350K标注行人，支持现有模型（如RVT和YOLOv8）的训练和评估。

Conclusion: SEPose展示了从模拟到现实的泛化能力，为事件传感器研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机和高斯泼溅技术虽能缓解问题，但仍面临噪声、帧质量差和色调不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督学习获取全局和细节知识，引入色调匹配模块保证颜色一致性，并创建首个真实数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功实现辐射场重建。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Motivation: 当前基准主要测试被动视觉感知，缺乏对主动视觉构建能力的评估，而后者是人类认知的核心能力。

Method: 设计Hyperphantasia基准，包含四个程序生成的谜题，分三个难度级别，评估模型表现。

Result: 现有模型在视觉模式识别上表现部分能力，但在主动视觉构建上仍存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 强化学习可能提升视觉模拟能力，但当前多模态大语言模型在主动视觉构建上仍需突破。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在多实例图像生成中难以处理实例间的关系差异和属性泄漏问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出RaDL框架，利用可学习参数增强实例属性，并通过关系注意力生成关系感知的图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是解决多实例图像生成中关系和属性问题的有效方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在泛化语义分割中的三个问题：粗粒度原型对齐、原型计算过拟合以及忽略特征适应难度差异。

Method: 提出PPAR框架，包括基于CLIP的原型生成（OTP和VTP）、渐进式对齐策略和原型重加权机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PPAR通过渐进式对齐和原型重加权，显著提升了语义分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和安全的MLLMs提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调整文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏置和空间偏置，直接添加到预训练模型的输出中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到最优性能，例如在跨数据集和领域泛化中分别提升2.23%和2.72%，内存使用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均显著优于现有方法，为TTA提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Conclusion: EC-Diff有效平衡了生成质量和推理速度，为边缘-云协作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

Motivation: 现有无监督部件发现方法缺乏跨类别和场景的鲁棒性，限制了应用范围。

Method: MPAE通过掩码图像学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: MPAE在多种类别和场景中鲁棒地发现了有意义的部件，并支持跨类别部件相似性分析。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督部件发现提供了更有效的范式，解决了遮挡和跨类别部件识别的挑战。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Method: 在去噪过程中融合不同风格模型的潜在空间，结合空间掩码和深度图条件控制。

Result: 成功实现区域特定的风格混合，保持各风格保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为风格混合提供了更精确的控制手段。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

Result: 在大规模数据集上验证，显著提升了预测置信度，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合意图推理的规划视角方法能有效提升运动预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 公共遥感数据集因分辨率差异和地物类别定义不一致而缺乏普适性，需要利用大量未标记数据提升模型性能。

Result: 在Potsdam数据集上的实验验证了SAMST的有效性和可行性，能够解决标记数据不足的问题。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力与小模型的训练效率，显著提升了伪标签精度和模型性能。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D面部动画缺乏细粒度风格化表情操纵的数据集，因此需要新的数据集和方法。

Method: 基于32个标准AUs和500个身份的数据集AUBlendSet，提出AUBlendNet网络学习不同风格的AU-Blendshape基向量。

Result: 通过实验验证了AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在风格化表情操纵、语音驱动动画和情感识别数据增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet为3D面部动画任务提供了重要工具，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FDAM的频率动态注意力调制策略，通过互补高低通滤波和动态频率加权，解决了ViTs中频率消失问题，提升了多种任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调节频率响应。

Method: FDAM包含Attention Inversion (AttInv)和Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale)两种技术，分别通过互补滤波和动态加权调节频率响应。

Result: 在SegFormer、DeiT等模型上，FDAM避免了表示崩溃，显著提升了语义分割、目标检测等任务的性能，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM是一种简单有效的频率动态调制方法，显著提升了ViTs的性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文将掩码图像建模（MIM）重新定义为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码增强特征提取，实现端到端的领域自适应分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号重建问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码一致性增强特征学习。

Result: 实验证明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，无需单独预训练即可提取领域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为领域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了掩码重建在特征提取中的显著优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Motivation: 研究如何利用深度学习方法解码大脑活动，尤其是对自然电影刺激的反应，以填补自然刺激与fMRI数据之间的时间分辨率差距。

Method: 采用时间卷积层的编码器-解码器模型，利用连续电影帧的时间相关性，预测视觉皮层及周围体素的活动，并通过显著性图分析贡献区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过深度学习模型可以探索视觉处理的机制，尤其是在自然电影刺激下的反应。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

Conclusion: 通过解耦-耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能，验证了多子域特征解耦的重要性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD是首个多视图新类发现框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR框架在视频内容中未充分利用运动与语义的复杂关系，MS-DETR旨在挖掘这一潜力。

Method: 通过编码器显式建模运动与语义的模态内关联，解码器利用跨模态任务关联实现精准定位；采用生成策略和对比去噪学习解决数据稀疏问题。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，MS-DETR显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过统一学习运动与语义特征，有效提升了视频时刻检索和高光检测的精度。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型多目标跟踪的三大挑战：目标外观特征稀缺、相机与目标动态复杂纠缠、频繁遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain检测增强框架和基于OC-SORT的独立于外观的鲁棒跟踪器，结合运动方向维护和自适应相似度度量。

Result: 在SMOT4SB公开测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂现实SMOT问题中表现出先进性和有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和高斯泼溅）依赖密集输入视图，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决稀疏视图输入下的车辆重建问题。

Method: 通过整合选择性光度损失（仅用于高置信度像素）和DUSt3R架构改进姿态估计，增强高斯泼溅技术。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

Motivation: 热浪对公共健康构成威胁，但现有路线规划系统缺乏阴影信息。论文旨在解决从卫星图像中估计阴影的困难，并填补生成模型训练数据的不足。

Method: 1. 构建包含多样地理区域和城市布局的数据集，利用Blender模拟建筑阴影；2. 提出DeepShade模型，结合RGB和Canny边缘层，通过对比学习捕捉阴影的时间变化规律。

Result: DeepShade在生成阴影图像方面表现优异，并成功应用于亚利桑那州坦佩市的路线规划。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，并展示了潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限和不完美数据集上容易误分类，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中表现优异，因此尝试将其用于医学分割。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，利用OoD数据监督完全监督的医学分割，无需外部数据、特征正则化目标或额外标注。

Conclusion: Med-OoD展示了OoD数据在医学分割中的潜力，提出了一种新的学习范式。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

TL;DR: 提出一种生成对抗性人脸的新方法，利用FRS特征空间的结构特性，实现高成功率且无需多次查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对FRS的安全和隐私构成威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或转移性，效率低且不实用。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中相同属性的个体形成的子空间，生成对抗性人脸，仅需单次非自适应查询。

Result: 在AWS的CompareFaces API上达到93%以上的成功率，且能控制高级属性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，显著提升了对抗性攻击的成功率和可控性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Conclusion: LidarPainter为驾驶场景重建提供了一种高效、高质量的解决方案，并支持多样化的风格扩展。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor
scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust

Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了其实际应用，现有方法独立修剪Q/K令牌导致性能下降，忽略了令牌交互的重要性。

Method: 提出Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion (BSPF-ViT)，联合修剪Q/K令牌并压缩保留令牌，利用对称注意力矩阵加速。

Result: BSPF-ViT在所有修剪级别上优于现有方法，ImageNet分类准确率提升1.3%-2.0%，计算开销减少50%，速度提升40%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT通过优化令牌修剪和融合，实现了高效且高性能的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架有效结合了双边网格的空间建模能力和MLP的非线性映射能力，提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且精确的动态场景建模和渲染方法，减少了对手动标注的依赖。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Conclusion: 双集成框架有效提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，为自动化诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，该方法有效提升了低光立体图像的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Result: 在多个数据集上，RODS显著提高了采样保真度和鲁棒性，检测并纠正了大量幻觉样本。

Conclusion: RODS在不增加额外训练成本的情况下，有效减少了扩散模型中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Method: 扩展数据集DD-VQA+，引入多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略，设计辅助损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，MGFFD-VLM在伪造判断和分析任务中优于现有方法，准确性更高。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过多粒度提示学习和辅助损失，显著提升了伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型在医学图像短语定位任务中更具优势，为临床应用提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Result: 结果表明该问题是可行的，但仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为健美操领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步探索。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结果，通过领域特定预训练和优化技术取得了较高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺部疾病，对极低出生体重婴儿有严重影响。现有的预防措施可能带来严重风险，因此早期预测BPD结果至关重要。

Method: 采用ResNet-50模型，结合领域特定预训练、渐进层冻结、CutMix增强和线性探测技术，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片进行预测。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时，AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67，显著优于ImageNet初始化和传统IRDS评分。

Conclusion: 领域特定预训练和优化技术能够从常规X光片中准确预测BPD结果，且方法计算可行，适合实际部署和未来联邦学习应用。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现优异，但存在隐私泄露和偏见传播的风险，需要一种方法可靠地删除敏感概念。

Result: FADE在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上表现优异，概念删除效果和图像质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FADE为安全和公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可删除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Result: DLC提升生成保真度，支持组合生成超出训练分布的样本，并实现文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: DLC为扩散模型提供高效、组合性强的表示，扩展了生成能力。

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: KeyDiff3D提供了一种高效、低成本的无监督3D关键点估计方法，并扩展了3D对象操作的可能性。

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18

Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解。

Method: 包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本与视觉特征的交互，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Motivation: 开发可靠的监控系统需要多样化和具有挑战性的数据集，以全面评估模型性能并促进公共安全。

Method: 提出了两个数据集，包含丰富的边界框和类别标注，并评估了RETMDET、YOLOX、RetinaNet、DETR和Deformable-DETR等先进目标检测模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更高效和鲁棒的目标检测架构奠定了基础，并提供了对所选模型性能的深入分析。

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuRe提出了一种通过硬负采样减少假阴性的方法，以改进组合图像检索（CIR）的性能，并引入了HP-FashionIQ数据集来评估模型与人类偏好的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽视了其他图像的相关性，导致假阴性问题，影响用户满意度。

Method: 提出Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling（QuRe），优化奖励模型目标以减少假阴性，并采用硬负采样策略选择相关图像。

Result: QuRe在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最先进性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上表现出与人类偏好的最强对齐。

Conclusion: QuRe通过减少假阴性和引入新数据集，显著提升了CIR的性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

*Haoyuan Liu,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU损失函数，通过插值框解决IoU不可导问题，提升小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数依赖手工几何惩罚，对框形状、大小和分布敏感，导致小目标优化不佳和框扩大问题。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，用插值框与目标的IoU替代手工惩罚；Dynamic InterpIoU动态调整插值系数。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC上优于现有IoU损失，小目标检测提升显著。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有IoU损失的问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的视频识别网络DVFL-Net，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在视频识别中表现出色但计算成本高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制，将大模型的知识迁移到轻量级学生模型中。

Result: DVFL-Net在多个基准测试中表现优异，平衡了性能和效率。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是一种适用于实时视频识别的高效解决方案。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Result: 在PIE数据集上，TA-STGCN比基线模型准确率提高了4.75%。

Conclusion: TA-STGCN有效提升了行人意图预测的准确性，适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

TL;DR: DAM-QA利用区域感知视觉语言模型DAM的能力，通过多区域视图聚合答案，显著提升了文本密集图像的VQA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本密集图像的VQA任务，需要细粒度提取文本信息，而DAM的区域级描述能力为此提供了潜力。

Method: 提出DAM-QA框架，通过聚合图像多区域视图的答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中表现优于基线DAM，DocVQA上提升7+分，且参数更少。

Conclusion: DAM类模型在高效使用和集成策略下，对文本密集和广泛VQA任务具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

strategy. By integrating advancements in computer vision, the system utilizes
YOLOv11 for object detection and state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation
models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative
analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy,
efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions. The system is evaluated in

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态理解中存在幻觉问题，现有方法成本高或数据分布不匹配。

Method: 提出SENTINEL框架，通过迭代采样、验证和分类构建域内偏好数据，并使用上下文感知偏好损失训练模型。

Result: SENTINEL将幻觉减少90%以上，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL通过早期干预和域内学习有效减少幻觉，具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Motivation: 现有模型未能捕捉放射科医生注视背后的意图，而理解这种意图对医学图像解读至关重要。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构处理注视数据的时空维度，生成诊断意图的粗粒度表示，并创建了三个意图标记数据集。

Result: RadGazeIntent在所有意图标记数据集上均优于基线方法，能准确预测放射科医生的注视目标。

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功模拟了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a
high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D
motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion,
with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed
RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and
motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms
existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading
dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.

Result: CytoSAE识别形态相关概念，验证了其泛化能力，并在AML分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学图像提供可解释性，性能媲美现有方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文学评估中的表现，揭示其是否具有类似人类评论家的个体化评价特征。

Method: 使用六种先进LLMs对十篇日本科幻小说进行七次独立评估，采用主成分分析和聚类技术分析数据。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α值1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同模型的评价词汇具有独特性。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent

distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session

minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，覆盖多种地图类型和主题，并分析了模型对地图设计变化的敏感性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要关注等值线图，覆盖范围有限，无法全面评估MLLMs的能力。

Method: 构建包含14,706个问答对的MapIQ数据集，涵盖三种地图类型和六种主题，评估多个MLLMs在六种视觉分析任务中的表现，并与人类基线对比。

Result: 实验揭示了MLLMs对地图设计变化的敏感性和鲁棒性，以及其对内部地理知识的依赖。

Conclusion: MapIQ为改进Map-VQA性能提供了潜在方向，并展示了MLLMs在地图理解中的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决波斯语情感分析中数据有限的问题，利用高资源语言的知识提升模型性能。

Method: 采用XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT三种预训练多语言模型，通过少样本和增量学习方法在波斯语数据上微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa在波斯语情感分析中达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型，能有效提升低资源语言的情感分析性能。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

TL;DR: PgM框架通过模态分割器将多模态表示分为单模态和配对模态特征，利用专用学习组件和重构解码器，实现灵活的特征学习和调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习需要充分利用单模态和跨模态交互的特征，现有方法未能明确区分和优化这两类特征。

Method: 提出PgM框架，包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和重构解码器，支持不同学习速率和特征分布调整。

Result: 在四个多模态任务中验证了PgM的有效性，并展示了其对现有模型的迁移能力。

Conclusion: PgM通过明确区分和优化单模态与配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA填补了表格问答系统的可解释性空白，适用于对审计要求高的领域。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，通过结合浅层语法分析和LLM，解决了Python笔记本中信息流和依赖关系的理解问题，显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习Python笔记本的复杂性和依赖问题，直接重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作往往不切实际。LLM在理解代码时存在幻觉和长上下文挑战，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出CRABS方法，结合浅层语法分析（如AST解析）和LLM的零样本学习，先通过语法分析捕获笔记本的上下界估计，再用LLM解决剩余歧义。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和依赖关系识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法通过结合语法分析和LLM，显著提高了笔记本信息流和依赖关系的理解准确性，为笔记本的评估和重用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

TL;DR: 本文通过可重复性研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理竞争性事实与反事实信息，重点关注注意力头的作用。研究发现，注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制来促进事实输出，且其行为具有领域依赖性。

Motivation: 研究动机是验证和调和Ortu等人、Yu、Merullo、Pavlick以及McDougall等人的发现，探讨模型学习事实与矛盾上下文信息之间的竞争机制。

Method: 使用机制解释工具分析注意力头强度与事实输出比率的关系，评估关于注意力头抑制机制的竞争性假设，并研究这些注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 研究发现，促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用复制抑制实现，而非选择性反事实抑制；注意力头行为具有领域依赖性，更大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 结论是注意力头的作用机制和领域依赖性对理解LLMs如何处理竞争性信息具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Method: 创建新数据集，使用机器学习和深度学习的最先进方法开发基线模型。

Result: 基线模型性能与现有最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: 发布的数据集和模型为印度语言识别研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

Motivation: 自回归语言模型的顺序生成特性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其在文本方向和语义已相对确定的后期生成阶段。

Method: 结合掩码输入、门控LoRA、轻量采样器、辅助训练损失和推测生成策略，实现多标记预测。

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升约2.5倍，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多标记预测显著加速生成过程，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient

dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and
few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to
biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Conclusion: DualReward框架灵活平衡了从可靠人工示例中学习和探索高质量干扰项的能力，适用于多样化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,
high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部存在独立的‘危害性’概念，与‘拒绝’方向不同，可用于构建更鲁棒的AI安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正理解危害性，而不仅仅是机械地拒绝有害指令。

Method: 通过识别‘危害性’方向，分析其与‘拒绝’方向的差异，并验证其对模型行为的影响。

Result: 发现‘危害性’概念独立于‘拒绝’，可用于检测不安全输入并减少过度拒绝。

Conclusion: LLMs对危害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更鲁棒，为AI安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循问题。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

*Yichen Xu,Liangyu Chen,Liang Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是首个大规模多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言，旨在解决现有图表理解基准的英语中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要基于英语，限制了其全球适用性。PolyChartQA旨在通过多语言支持提升图表的全球可访问性。

Method: 采用解耦管道分离图表数据和渲染代码，利用LLM翻译和严格质量控制生成多语言图表。

Result: 实验显示，英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

### [104] [BlockBPE: Parallel BPE Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11941)
*Amos You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了高吞吐量的批量推理，性能优于现有CPU绑定的实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPE实现（如HuggingFace Tokenizers和tiktoken）在CPU上运行效率低，且因Regex预分词导致时间复杂度较高。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词，实现高度并行化的token合并，将时间复杂度降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE为GPU上的BPE分词提供了高效解决方案，适合高吞吐量场景。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

*Yi Zhao,Zuchao Li,Hai Zhao,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，以实现细粒度的提示压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌的重要性以及压缩过程中熵的变化。

Method: 提出DAC方法，动态整合熵和注意力信息，感知压缩过程中的熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在各种任务和LLMs上均表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC方法通过动态感知熵和注意力信息，显著提升了提示压缩的效果。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

### [106] [IAM: Efficient Inference through Attention Mapping between Different-scale LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11953)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLMs注意力矩阵的高相似性，优化注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有方法未充分利用外部信息优化。

Method: 分析注意力矩阵相似性，提出IAM框架，实现小规模和大规模LLMs间的注意力映射。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM具有通用性，且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多跳推理和时间问题上表现不佳，而基于查询的知识图谱问答（KGQA）提供了一种模块化替代方案。

Conclusion: 查询驱动的多阶段KGQA框架能有效提升多跳和时间问题的性能，尤其适合小语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle
with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA
(KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of
direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA,
proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method
using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based
multi-stage KGQA framework for improving multi-hop and temporal QA with small
language models. Code and data: https://github.com/ar2max/NLDB-KGQA-System

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，在极低精度格式下优于现有技术，并通过更高效的反量化实现更快推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs部署因高计算资源需求而困难，现有PoT量化在GPU上效果不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准优化，提出新型PoT量化框架。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化技术，反量化速度在NVIDIA V100和RTX 4090上分别提升3.67倍和1.63倍。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架显著提升LLM部署效率，适用于低精度场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

### [109] [Toxicity-Aware Few-Shot Prompting for Low-Resource Singlish Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11966)
*Ziyu Ge,Gabriel Chua,Leanne Tan,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性的翻译，以新加坡英语为例，通过人工验证的少样本提示工程和模型优化，提升翻译质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，低资源语言和方言的翻译常无法保留本地俚语、混合语和文化嵌入的有害言论标记，且缺乏平行数据和安全过滤器的支持。

Method: 1. 人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选和排序新加坡英语示例；2. 通过直接和回译优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升翻译质量，还支持低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核，强调保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）在阅读理解中的表现，通过图结构分析发现LLMs在语言理解上具有高度一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与LLMs在阅读理解中的差异，以改进人机协作学习策略。

Method: 使用LLM将文本转化为基于语义的图结构，并通过眼动数据验证重要节点和边的注视分布。

Result: LLMs在图拓扑结构层面表现出高度一致的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 研究为人类与AI的协作学习提供了新见解，并验证了图结构分析的有效性。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了价值相似性对LLM代理关系建立的影响，发现高价值相似性代理间信任和亲密度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工社会中价值相似性是否像人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值可控性，主实验分析价值相似代理的信任和亲密度。

Result: 高价值相似性代理间信任和亲密度更高。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并为新理论提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

*Lukas Ellinger,Miriam Anschütz,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，简化定义会降低多义词的完整性，增加误解风险。通过微调模型可显著改善定义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简化定义对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）的影响，尤其是多义词的定义质量。

Method: 使用两种新评估数据集，测试多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），结合LLM-as-Judge和人工标注。

Result: 简化定义会显著降低完整性，忽略多义性。微调Llama 3.1 8B能显著提升定义质量。

Conclusion: 教育NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Motivation: 解决神经语言模型中数据和参数效率的挑战，通过表示分析和优化技术增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 1. 分析语言表示的动态特性，提出基于Jacobian和Hessian矩阵的正则化策略；2. 结合主动学习和参数高效微调，减少标注和计算资源需求；3. 利用上下文学习增强弱监督技术，有效利用未标注数据。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法在性能、稳定性和效率上显著优于传统方法，尤其在低资源和动态数据环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为语言模型的高效训练和泛化提供了新思路，特别适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Method: 测试包括多种任务，通过OCSAI工具自动评估答案的原创性、精细度和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准上优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项中表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展创造力（E-creativity），而LLMs更倾向于固定创造力（F-creativity）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs在语言创造力方面表现优异，但与人类在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the
classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the
classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach
follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了长文本共指消解基准的空白，为未来研究提供了资源，并指出了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Motivation: 许多学生在数学学习中遇到困难，导致回避数学相关学科。研究旨在探索更优的教学方法，提升数学学习效果。

Method: 采用组内设计，随机分配问题，比较MEGA方法与传统CoT方法。使用GSM8K和MATH数据集，评估GPT4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet两种LLM。

Result: MEGA方法在两种数据集中均更受学生认可，尤其在MATH数据集中表现显著优于CoT方法（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在数学学习中效果更佳，尤其适合解释难题。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

*Payal Bhattad,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao,Anju Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLM）文本增强的框架，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率上的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保留和稳定性上的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时。

Method: 提出两个评估组件：可扩展性分析（测量语义一致性）和IASR（评估语义漂移）。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo表现最佳，应用于BERTopic任务时，主题粒度增加400%，完全消除主题重叠。

Conclusion: 验证了所提框架在实际NLP任务中评估LLM增强的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

### [120] [Overview of the Sensemaking Task at the ELOQUENT 2025 Lab: LLMs as Teachers, Students and Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12143)
*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过三步评估生成模型的理解能力：问题生成、回答和评分。2025年实验涵盖多语言材料，4团队参与，发现LLM在问题生成和答案限制上存在问题，且评分系统易受干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型建立可测试的高层次评估标准，通过模拟课堂考试的三步流程（问题生成、回答、评分）来评估模型的理解能力。

Method: 使用多语言材料（如教科书、讲座录音等），4团队提交2种教师、学生和评分系统，并加入商业LLM基线，进行自动与人工评估对比。

Result: 问题生成质量难以评估；LLM回答问题表现尚可，但受限于输入文本；评分系统易误判干扰内容。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成评估方法，优化LLM答案限制能力，并提升评分系统的抗干扰性。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分析眼动和键盘数据揭示隐藏的认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究翻译行为背后的认知和情感状态，以更好地理解翻译过程中的动态。

Method: 通过记录和分析眼动和键盘数据，构建多层次的行为翻译风格空间（BTSS）。

Result: BTSS能够作为计算翻译代理的基础，模拟翻译过程中的情感、自动行为和认知动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为理解翻译行为提供了新视角，并为开发模拟人类翻译的计算模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了一种在低资源环境下无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，使用自监督学习（SSL）模型进行编码，发现SSL表示在处理儿童数据时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，传统的自动语音识别（ASR）方法可能不适用，因此需要探索一种无需ASR的评估方法，尤其针对儿童语音数据。

Method: 采用少量样本学习方法，将儿童语音输入与成人参考模板进行比较，使用SSL模型的中间层进行编码，并研究了离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在成人语音上表现良好，但在儿童语音输入上表现显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表示在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

### [123] [Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252)
*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了token级和phrase级融合的优势，利用LLM提升ASR关键词识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时的不足。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合token级和phrase级融合，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最优性能，同时保持非关键词文本的高准确率。

Conclusion: token级和phrase级组件在多粒度框架中互补，显著提升了性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-index的定量测量方法，用于评估翻译文本的翻译特征（translationese），并通过实验验证其鲁棒性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对翻译特征的定量测量，T-index旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用两个对比性微调的语言模型（LMs）计算T-index，并在合成数据集和真实翻译数据集上进行评估。

Result: T-index能有效捕捉翻译特征，与人类标注结果高度相关（Pearson's $r = 0.568$），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种鲁棒且高效的翻译特征测量方法，可作为MT质量评估的补充指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

*Johann Frei,Nils Feldhus,Lisa Raithel,Roland Roller,Alexander Meyer,Frank Kramer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infherno是一个基于LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库的端到端框架，用于将非结构化临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决了现有方法的通用性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如模块化规则系统或指令调优的LLM）在通用性和结构一致性上表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Infherno框架，结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，实现端到端的转换。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源时表现接近人类基准，并支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno为临床数据集成提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，推动了FHIR标准的应用。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的基准来评估文本异常检测方法，限制了方法的比较和创新，因此作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用多种预训练语言模型（如GloVe、BERT、LLaMa等）的嵌入，结合多领域文本数据集和全面的评估指标（如AUROC、AUPRC），进行系统评估。

Result: 研究发现嵌入质量对异常检测效果至关重要，且深度学习方法在LLM嵌入下并未优于传统浅层算法（如KNN、Isolation Forest）。

Conclusion: 通过开源基准工具包，为未来研究提供了基础，并揭示了嵌入质量的重要性及高效模型评估策略。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现有代码LLMs在VHDL代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现其性能不足，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes)的新方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）领域的研究较少，导致其在该领域的适用性不足。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码）并将其与原始输入结合，以提升LLMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略，显著提升了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅改善了VHDL任务的性能，还为未来研究提供了框架，以进一步优化LLMs在VHDL领域的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

TL;DR: 研究发现，阿尔茨海默病（AD）语音感知中存在性别偏见，男性语音更易被识别为AD，尤其在中文语音中。声学分析显示，男性语音的shimmer值与AD感知显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的影响，为开发更公平的AD检测模型提供依据。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值和语音部分）。

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，用于提升大语言模型（LLMs）在检测和解决用户请求模糊性方面的能力，实验表明该框架显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理用户请求时存在模糊性问题，需要一种方法增强其检测和解决能力。

Method: 引入多智能体辩论框架，结合三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B和Mistral-7B变体）和多样化模糊性数据集进行实验。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升了Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B变体的性能，其中Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率高达76.7%，尤其在复杂模糊性和高效共识方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是一种有效的方法，能够增强LLM的能力，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在实时网络浏览能力下，是否能从社交媒体用户名推断用户人口统计信息，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs访问社交媒体内容并预测用户人口统计信息的能力。

Result: LLMs能够以合理准确度预测用户人口统计信息，但可能对低活跃度账户引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: 该能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但存在滥用风险，建议限制公开应用，保留研究用途的受控访问。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否可用于检测算术错误，以实现轻量级自我修正。

Method: 使用3位数加法作为控制实验，训练探针解码隐藏状态，并扩展到结构化思维链任务。

Result: 探针准确率超过90%，并能推广到复杂任务，通过选择性重新提示提升准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为轻量级自我修正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据感知过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据进行决策，但现有LLMs和传统RAG框架在处理异构数据时存在局限性。

Method: 采用混合检索策略（密集嵌入和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和量化索引，结合人工反馈优化。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Faithfulness等定性指标显著提高。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升企业任务响应质量，未来将扩展至多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为S2WTM的新方法，通过利用球形切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于变分自编码器的神经主题模型（VAE-NTMs）在超球空间中建模时容易发生后验坍塌，导致潜在表示失效。

Method: 提出S2WTM方法，采用单位超球面上的先验分布，并利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验。

Result: 实验表明，S2WTM在生成主题的连贯性和多样性上优于现有方法，并在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的方法，通过显式优化数据选择目标，将预训练数据与评估基准对齐，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索显式优化数据选择目标的效果，以解决实践中通过基准驱动迭代隐含目标的问题。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全语料库的评分。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10项任务中的9项上表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍，且在不同规模模型上均表现良好。

Conclusion: 结论是直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需根据模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

### [136] [CompressedVQA-HDR: Generalized Full-reference and No-reference Quality Assessment Models for Compressed High Dynamic Range Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11900)
*Wei Sun,Linhan Cao,Kang Fu,Dandan Zhu,Jun Jia,Menghan Hu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出CompressedVQA-HDR框架，用于评估HDR视频压缩质量，结合Swin Transformer和SigLip 2网络，在FR和NR模型中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法对HDR视频的泛化能力不足，需开发更有效的评估框架。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取结构和纹理相似性；NR模型使用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和微调解决数据不足问题。

Result: 模型在FR和NR任务中表现最优，CompressedVQA-HDR-FR在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中夺冠。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Motivation: 量化与疾病进展和治疗反应相关的图像模式对个体化治疗和新疗法开发至关重要。

Method: 使用深度聚类网络将医学图像块编码并聚类到低维潜在空间，建立组织词汇表。

Result: 该方法在非酒精性脂肪性肝炎患者的随机对照试验中验证，能识别与治疗相关的组织变化路径，并优于非成像指标。

Conclusion: 该方法可预测非侵入性影像数据的活检特征，并在独立队列中验证了其适用性。

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at

Conclusion: HCOMC框架为混合交通流中的匝道合流问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

Abstract: As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,
so will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and
social integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both
indoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is
based on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,
offering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in
spatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs
has focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;
approaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these
challenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on
the Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and
obstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational
efficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav
Chair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three
distinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,
conducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor
building environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control
navigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed
comparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task
completion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being
safer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of
usability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and
performance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end
users, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.

Abstract: In robotics, the effective integration of environmental data into actionable
knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the variety and
incompatibility of data formats commonly used in scene descriptions, such as
MJCF, URDF, and SDF. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses these
challenges by developing a unified scene graph model that standardizes these
varied formats into the Universal Scene Description (USD) format. This
standardization facilitates the integration of these scene graphs with robot
ontologies through semantic reporting, enabling the translation of complex
environmental data into actionable knowledge essential for cognitive robotic
control. We evaluated our approach by converting procedural 3D environments
into USD format, which is then annotated semantically and translated into a
knowledge graph to effectively answer competency questions, demonstrating its
utility for real-time robotic decision-making. Additionally, we developed a
web-based visualization tool to support the semantic mapping process, providing
users with an intuitive interface to manage the 3D environment.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

Conclusion: CDT-TCS及其衍生算法为解决系留机器人运动规划问题提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.

Abstract: Adaptive mission control and dynamic parameter reconfiguration are essential
for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied,
communication-limited marine environments. However, most current AUV platforms
execute static, pre-programmed missions or rely on tethered connections and
high-latency acoustic channels for mid-mission updates, significantly limiting
their adaptability and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce NemeSys, a
novel AUV system designed to support real-time mission reconfiguration through
compact optical and magnetoelectric (OME) signaling facilitated by floating
buoys. We present the full system design, control architecture, and a semantic
mission encoding framework that enables interactive exploration and task
adaptation via low-bandwidth communication. The proposed system is validated
through analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and
open-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation
and semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for
goal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.

introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a

Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在密集交通中的运动规划常因无法预测周围车辆的交互行为而表现保守，传统方法依赖非交互预测，忽略了车辆间的动态响应。

Method: 结合神经网络预测周围车辆对MPPI采样控制序列的反应，并引入基于样条的MPPI采样分布先验，以优化车道变换行为。

Result: 在密集交通合并场景中验证了方法的有效性，能够高效完成合并操作。

Conclusion: IANN-MPPI通过交互感知和优化采样分布，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的规划能力。

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is
challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning
objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate
and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional
decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions
that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural
Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which
enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents
may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in
structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI
sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate
IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to
perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has rapidly emerged as a
transformative force in aquaculture, enabling intelligent synthesis of
multimodal data, including text, images, audio, and simulation outputs for
smarter, more adaptive decision-making. As the aquaculture industry shifts
toward data-driven, automation and digital integration operations under the
Aquaculture 4.0 paradigm, GAI models offer novel opportunities across
environmental monitoring, robotics, disease diagnostics, infrastructure
planning, reporting, and market analysis. This review presents the first
comprehensive synthesis of GAI applications in aquaculture, encompassing
foundational architectures (e.g., diffusion models, transformers, and retrieval
augmented generation), experimental systems, pilot deployments, and real-world
use cases. We highlight GAI's growing role in enabling underwater perception,
digital twin modeling, and autonomous planning for remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) missions. We also provide an updated application taxonomy that spans
sensing, control, optimization, communication, and regulatory compliance.
Beyond technical capabilities, we analyze key limitations, including limited
data availability, real-time performance constraints, trust and explainability,
environmental costs, and regulatory uncertainty. This review positions GAI not
merely as a tool but as a critical enabler of smart, resilient, and
environmentally aligned aquaculture systems.

Conclusion: 单步去噪扩散模型能有效提升自动驾驶车辆在交叉路口的决策安全性。

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Motivation: 人行道送货机器人因行人密度、障碍物和基础设施条件导致旅行时间不可靠，影响效率，需开发鲁棒路径规划方法。

Conclusion: 鲁棒路径规划方法优于传统最短路径，特别适用于宽、慢且导航保守的机器人，在复杂环境中表现更优。

Abstract: Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight
distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园中GPS信号不可靠且标准SLAM方法因树木外观重复易出错，需开发针对性解决方案以实现精准树木映射。

Method: 利用RGB-D图像检测树干，通过实例分割模型和级联图数据关联算法重新识别树干，结合噪声GPS、里程计和树干观测构建因子图框架。

Result: 在苹果和梨园的多季节数据集中验证，定位误差低至18厘米，小于种植距离的20%。

Conclusion: Tree-SLAM在GPS信号不可靠时仍能实现高精度树木映射，适用于果园精准农业。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision
agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like
targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps
is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree
canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can
confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce
Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual
trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with
an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them
using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified
trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS
signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of
individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less
than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on
diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,
demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable
GPS signals.

Abstract: Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development, while
collecting detailed data on its related features remains challenging due to the
high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery
robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution
to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile
data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to
walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped
robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101
trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of
features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,
duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk
utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications
were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that
pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk
characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity
associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed
closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for
assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous
monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the
development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.

Abstract: As industrial autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly deployed in
safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse
conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety
verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling
and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which
exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's
operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data
collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic
transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that
encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety
properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are
verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,
provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with
regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 新方法解决了意图不确定性问题，显著提升了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

Motivation: 现有LGL方法通常仅考虑部分信息或针对单一传感器，忽视了统一性。

Result: 实验表明UniLGL在真实环境中表现优异，适用于多种平台和场景。

Conclusion: UniLGL在工业与野外场景中展现出高精度定位与协作探索的潜力。

Abstract: Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,
geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous
LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL
method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and
material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the
proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both
geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial
BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network
is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and
material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a
viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional
translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and
supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors
and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local
features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose
estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on
SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness
of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world
environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively
competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL
has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping
as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,
demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path

such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on
generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating
simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs
across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate
success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text
prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on
larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models
generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not
universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,
and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These
results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint
adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future
LLM development in robotic path planning.

paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:
