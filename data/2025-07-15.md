### [1] [View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831)
*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL（View Invariant Learning）的后训练策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）策略对相机视角变化的鲁棒性，并在V2-VLNCE场景中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航策略对相机视角变化敏感，影响了智能体在连续环境中的导航性能。

Method: 采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并通过教师-学生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE场景中，性能提升8-15%；在标准VLNCE场景中，性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，能显著提升导航策略的鲁棒性，且不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfake Talking Heads from Facial Biometric Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08917)
*Justin D. Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于面部生物特征异常模式的深度学习检测技术，用于识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术容易被用于欺诈、诈骗和政治虚假信息传播，亟需有效的检测手段。

Method: 利用面部生物特征中的异常模式，开发了一种机器学习检测技术。

Result: 在大规模深度伪造数据集上评估了该技术，并测试了其对视频篡改的鲁棒性和对未知生成器的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该技术能有效检测深度伪造视频，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

### [3] [PRISM: Reducing Spurious Implicit Biases in Vision-Language Models with LLM-Guided Embedding Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08979)
*Mahdiyar Molahasani,Azadeh Motamedi,Michael Greenspan,Il-Min Kim,Ali Etemad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据且任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的隐含偏差。通过两阶段操作（生成场景描述和对比式去偏损失），PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生偏斜预测，PRISM旨在无需预定义偏差类别或额外数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）使用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）通过对比式去偏损失学习投影，将嵌入映射到减少虚假相关性并保持图像-文本对齐的潜在空间。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种高效且无需外部数据的去偏方法，适用于视觉语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

### [4] [Video Inference for Human Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08981)
*Hanbyel Cho,Jaesung Ahn,Yooshin Cho,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空和运动学信息的HMR-ViT方法，通过构建时空-运动学特征图像并使用Vision Transformer，显著提升了人体网格恢复的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法仅利用时空或运动学信息，未结合两者，限制了性能提升。

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用Channel Rearranging Matrix优化特征排列，结合Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了人体网格恢复的性能。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

### [5] [From images to properties: a NeRF-driven framework for granular material parameter inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09005)
*Cheng-Hsi Hsiao,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合NeRF和MPM的新框架，通过视觉观测推断颗粒材料特性，摩擦角估计误差在2度以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接测量不切实际或不可能的情况下，通过视觉观测表征颗粒材料特性。

Method: 生成合成实验数据，利用NeRF重建3D几何，通过MPM模拟和贝叶斯优化估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

### [6] [VISTA: A Visual Analytics Framework to Enhance Foundation Model-Generated Data Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09008)
*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提升多模态基础模型生成标签的质量，通过结合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，解决现有方法在数据质量评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，缺乏对多模态模型生成标签质量的全面评估，导致潜在问题未被充分解决。

Method: 提出VISTA框架，整合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，用于识别和修正标签中的隐藏问题。

Result: 在开放词汇图像分割任务中，VISTA通过定量和定性分析展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA显著提升了多模态模型生成标签的质量，为复杂任务提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

### [8] [Can Contrastive Learning Improve Class-Imbalanced Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09052)
*Fang Chen,Alex Villa,Gongbo Liang,Xiaoyi Lu,Meng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于解决类别不平衡数据中尾部类别图像合成多样性不足的问题，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成多样性不足，影响扩散模型的性能。

Method: 引入无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比学习和条件-无条件对齐增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，显著提升了类别不平衡扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无限视频理解（Infinite Video Understanding）作为多媒体研究的下一个前沿目标，旨在解决长视频处理中的计算、内存和时序一致性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）和多模态扩展（MLLMs）在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但处理超长视频仍面临计算、内存和时序一致性等难题。

Method: 提出将无限视频理解作为研究方向，推动流式架构、持久内存机制、分层自适应表示、事件中心推理等创新。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了实现无限视频理解的核心挑战和研究方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是一个雄心勃勃但逻辑合理的研究目标，可为多媒体和AI社区提供创新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

### [10] [BlindSight: Harnessing Sparsity for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09071)
*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BlindSight方法，通过利用注意力稀疏性优化视觉语言模型的推理效率，减少计算量（FLOPs）同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）因处理图像数据导致提示长度增加和注意力计算复杂度高，影响推理速度。

Method: 分析VLMs中的注意力模式，发现稀疏性，提出基于输入模板的注意力稀疏掩码（BlindSight），无需训练即可优化推理。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上测试，FLOPs减少32%-41%，准确性变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight是一种高效且无需训练的VLM推理优化方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 展望下一代基础模型的发展，强调统一建模能力、跨领域泛化和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的零样本方法，通过扰动生成视频模型提取光流，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型通用模型启发，探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型直接输出光流，避免微调。

Method: 基于CWM范式，提出KL-tracing方法，通过局部扰动和KL散度计算光流。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上分别相对提升16.6%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 生成视频模型的对抗提示是高质量光流提取的可扩展替代方案。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器视觉在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用，理解卷积神经网络的内部机制及其推理原因变得至关重要。

Method: MI CAM通过计算特征图与输入图像的互信息来加权，并通过线性组合权重和激活图生成显著性可视化。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上均优于现有方法，并通过反事实分析验证了其因果解释能力。

Conclusion: MI CAM提供了一种高效且无偏的视觉解释方法，适用于模型推理过程的解释。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo通过整合放射科医生的眼动视频序列，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在胸部X光报告生成和疾病诊断中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的顺序信息，而RadEyeVideo旨在捕捉时空动态以增强模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入，利用支持视频输入的通用LVLMs进行评估。

Result: 模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学LVLMs。

Conclusion: 有效整合专家知识（眼动信息）可显著提升通用模型在临床任务中的表现，RadEyeVideo为医疗图像分析提供了可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

*Maoxiao Ye,Xinfeng Ye,Mano Manoharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），通过多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制提升生成质量和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归方法在推理阶段的误差累积问题，以及扩散模型在实时任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上验证了方法的生成质量和实时效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了手语生成的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明SAMPL优于现有方法，显著提升了模型在干扰条件下的性能。

Conclusion: RoHOI为HOI检测的鲁棒性评估提供了新标准，SAMPL策略有效提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.
Benchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了CLIP模型中模态间隙的重要性，而模态间隙对其泛化和适应能力至关重要。

Method: 分析了视觉-语言预训练模型微调过程中模态间隙的变化，提出MG-CLIP方法，通过保持和补偿模态间隙来优化持续学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MG-CLIP优于现有方法，且无需额外的回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP提供了一种简单有效的方法来提升CLIP模型的持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Result: MoMask++在HumanML3D和SnapMoGen基准测试中表现最优，并能处理用户输入的随意提示。

Conclusion: SnapMoGen数据集和MoMask++模型显著提升了文本到动作生成的细粒度控制和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于非线性MLP的视觉语言连接器，用于改进语言引导的姿态估计，显著提升了定位精度，同时保持了零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；LocLLM的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂的空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM采用两层的非线性MLP（带GELU激活）作为视觉语言连接器，增强视觉块与文本描述的融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），并在Human-Art和MPII上表现出强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升了语言引导姿态估计的定位精度，且不牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的四维占用预测框架$I^{2}$-World，通过解耦场景标记化实现动态表达，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂3D场景的高效标记化问题，以应对极端情况。

Method: 采用双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合编码器-解码器架构，实现高效的四维占用预测。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU上分别优于现有方法25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9 GB内存，37.0 FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均表现出色，为3D场景预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Score Distillation (SSD)框架，通过锚定单一分类器到源提示，提升编辑过程的稳定性和对齐性，解决了现有方法在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像和3D编辑方法（如Delta Denoising Score）存在稳定性差、空间控制不足和编辑强度受限的问题，主要源于对复杂辅助结构的依赖。

Method: SSD利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入常数项null-text分支以稳定优化过程，同时结合提示增强分支提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得最先进结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD为文本引导编辑提供了高效、稳定的解决方案，保持了内容结构并确保编辑轨迹与源提示紧密对齐。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示池有效解决了FSCIL中的性能退化问题，为增量学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过缓解图像对齐偏差，显著提升了多模态对齐效果，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME方法有效解决了动态场景图生成中的关键问题，为复杂场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案，适用于开放道路场景。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be

*Jingguo Liu,Han Yu,Shigang Li,Jianfeng Li*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的球形采样方法，用于全景图像，直接利用现有的二维预训练模型，减少失真并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模全景图像数据集，现有任务依赖二维预训练模型，但这些模型无法处理全景图像的失真和不连续性。

Method: 采用基于预训练模型权重的球形离散采样方法，减少失真并获得良好的初始训练值；应用于全景图像分割，利用球形模型特征作为特定通道注意力的掩码。

Result: 在常用室内数据集Stanford2D3D上取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像处理中的失真问题，并提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

### [31] [Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217)
*Görkay Aydemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线点跟踪方法Track-On，利用视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，在无需未来帧信息的情况下实现长期跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测（仅使用当前和过去帧），而现有方法多为离线设置，依赖未来帧。

Method: 结合视觉基础模型和Transformer架构，设计Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点作为查询处理视频帧。

Result: Track-On在七个公共基准测试中取得最新成果，证明了无需未来帧的长期跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: Track-On为在线点跟踪提供了高效解决方案，展示了视觉基础模型与Transformer结合的潜力。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP）解决基础模型在视觉和医学任务中的分布偏移和置信度失准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现优异，但在实际部署中面临分布偏移和置信度失准的挑战。现有解决方案多为领域特定，缺乏统一方法。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包含FIP（通过Fisher信息惩罚减少分布偏移）和CMP（通过Brier分数优化校准置信度），适用于视觉分类和医学分割任务。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集上提升3.5%准确率，降低28% ECE；在医学分割任务中达到84.7% DSC和4.8mm HD95，跨域性能差距降低40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一种即插即用的统一框架，能有效解决基础模型的分布偏移和置信度失准问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

*G. Kutay Türkoglu,Julian Tanke,Iheb Belgacem,Lev Markhasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，从第一人称视角（egocentric）重建可动画化虚拟形象，利用Stable Diffusion减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从第一人称视角重建人体外观时的遮挡和比例失真问题，填补生成先验方法在此领域的空白。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出一种从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入图像到运动模型。

Result: 首次实现了从第一人称视角输入生成可动画化虚拟形象，减少了训练依赖多视角数据集的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和泛化的远程呈现系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Result: 实验表明，PPJudge在准确性、鲁棒性和与人类判断的一致性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算创意和艺术教育提供了新视角。

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

TL;DR: AGCD-Net提出了一种基于注意力引导的上下文去偏模型，通过混合ConvNeXt和因果干预模块，有效减少情感识别中的上下文偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别方法存在上下文偏差问题，例如背景与情感标签的虚假关联，影响了真实场景中的情感计算效果。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过因果去偏技术，显著提升了复杂场景下的情感识别鲁棒性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊时存在不足，尤其是对软正负样本的处理不充分，限制了模型学习能力。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局和局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互，以及动量对比学习扩展负样本集。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上，AAHR优于现有方法，提升了匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR通过多策略结合有效解决了语义模糊和高阶关系问题，为图像-文本匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无注释符号翻译方法虽性能提升，但模型复杂度和计算需求高，难以扩展。

Method: 利用符号分段将连续视频转换为离散视觉标记，引入标记间对比对齐目标和双级监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准上性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和扩展性上均优于现有技术，验证了标记化和对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: MLLMs在医疗等安全关键领域的应用受到提示设计敏感性和高置信度错误响应的限制，需要改进其置信度校准以提高可靠性。

Method: 提出Prompt4Trust框架，通过训练轻量级LLM生成辅助提示，指导下游任务MLLM生成置信度更准确的响应。

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中取得最先进的性能，同时展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust通过自动化提示工程提升了MLLMs在安全关键领域的可信度，具有潜在的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合语义信息，显著提升了楼层平面图定位的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 在真实ESD数据集上实验表明，Geo-RepNet在复杂手术场景中表现最优，兼具鲁棒性和高效性。

Conclusion: 深度信息显著提升手术阶段识别性能，Geo-RepNet为复杂手术环境提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

*Zile Wang,Hao Yu,Jiabo Zhan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ALPHA基准和ALPHAVAE模型，用于RGBA图像生成，显著提升了透明图像的重建和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在RGB图像合成上表现优异，但透明或分层内容（RGBA图像）的生成缺乏大规模基准和有效方法。

Method: 提出ALPHA基准，将标准RGB指标扩展到四通道图像；开发ALPHAVAE模型，扩展预训练RGB VAE，加入专用alpha通道，采用复合目标训练。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅8K图像训练下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提高3.2%，优于现有方法LayerDiffuse。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE在透明图像生成和重建上表现优越，为RGBA图像生成提供了新基准和方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

TL;DR: 论文提出了ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，用于评估多模态对话系统的主动交互能力，PAUC优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统的研究增多，用户期望系统能更主动交互，但缺乏相关评估工具。

Method: 引入ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，考虑响应时间动态性，通过基准测试和用户研究验证。

Result: PAUC与传统指标相比更符合人类偏好，能更准确评估主动交互场景。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互提供了更可靠的用户体验评估方法。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练方法仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整类间混淆损失，并结合音频、视频及其融合的新训练框架；采用聚类引导的自监督预训练策略解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，接近最先进水平。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过动态混淆损失和细粒度对齐显著提升模型性能，各模块的必要性通过消融实验验证。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Motivation: 3D多模态大语言模型在场景理解方面表现优异，但计算效率低下限制了其实际部署。主要瓶颈在于处理过多的对象中心视觉令牌。

Method: Fast3D包含两项技术创新：1) 全局注意力预测(GAP)，通过轻量级神经网络预测全局注意力分布；2) 样本自适应剪枝(SAP)，动态调整剪枝比例。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，Fast3D在高剪枝比例下表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Fast3D为3D多模态大语言模型提供了一种高效的视觉令牌剪枝解决方案，无需修改目标模型参数。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究复杂多阶段或多表示融合架构是否必要，探索简单架构在预训练支持下能否超越专用设计。

Method: 采用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究预训练对TAD性能的影响，包括自监督Masked Video Modeling（MVM）和领域自适应预训练（DAPT）。

Result: 简单架构在强预训练下性能优于专用方法；自监督MVM效果最佳；DAPT进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可实现高效、可扩展的TAD。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 该模型通过高效时空设计，在多人体运动预测任务中取得了计算效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Conclusion: CKAA通过知识对齐和自适应聚合，显著提升了模型对误导任务ID的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Conclusion: LifelongPR框架有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型的适应性和实用性。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

Conclusion: 双曲空间中的MIM和知识蒸馏技术能够高效捕捉视觉-语义层次结构，并在下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

### [59] [GLIMPSE: Do Large Vision-Language Models Truly Think With Videos or Just Glimpse at Them?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09491)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频理解基准测试，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能够真正进行视频推理，而不仅仅是静态帧分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试过于依赖静态帧分析，无法评估模型是否具备深层次的时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，覆盖11个类别，所有问题需完整观看视频并进行上下文推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，而最佳模型GPT-o3仅达66.43%，显示LVLMs在视频推理上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在视频理解上的局限性，需进一步改进以实现真正的视频推理。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于张量分解和正则化的自适应网络SDTN，并结合轻量级网络TRN，用于高光谱图像分类，显著提升了精度并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺时表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合SDTN（自适应张量正则化网络）和TRN（张量正则化网络），动态调整张量秩并提取多尺度特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法，精度显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: 该方法适合资源受限环境下的实时部署，为高光谱图像分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决缓存方法和决策边界不可靠的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在分布偏移的下游任务中表现不佳，且缺乏标注数据时难以适应。测试时适应（TTA）旨在解决这一问题，但现有方法存在熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活的问题。

Method: 提出ReTA方法，包含CER（利用一致性约束重加权熵以优化缓存）和DDC（通过多元高斯分布建模类文本嵌入，实现自适应决策边界）。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实世界分布偏移下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略提升了测试时适应的可靠性，为分布偏移下的视觉语言任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势识别任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba和MedMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VMamba等SSM模型在四向扫描中的空间冗余问题，提升效率而无需重新训练。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，通过剪枝冗余空间激活并利用最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%的速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和医疗影像任务中表现类似。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的部署效率工具，适用于SSM模型且不影响迁移性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，通过最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，结合细节保留正则化和提示学习，显著提升了去雾效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，难以充分利用无配对训练的优势。

Method: 利用Schrödinger Bridge和最优传输理论，直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布；引入细节保留正则化和基于CLIP的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的分词策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的KIE性能，同时减少了计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且分词方法效率低下，导致计算冗余和内存浪费。

Method: 提出VDInstruct模型，采用内容感知分词策略和三阶段训练范式，分离空间区域检测与语义特征提取。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5分，图像令牌数量减少3.6倍。

Conclusion: 内容感知分词结合显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有效方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的红外小目标检测模型通常忽视目标的稀疏性先验，导致模型复杂且泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出DRPCA-Net，结合动态展开机制和轻量级超网络，自适应生成迭代参数，并引入动态残差组（DRG）模块优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态建模稀疏性先验，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Motivation: 由于光学镜头焦距和红外探测器分辨率的限制，远距离CSIST群在红外图像中通常表现为混合斑点，缺乏高质量数据集限制了研究进展。

Method: 提出了Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet)，包含Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA)模块，实现帧间信息自适应聚合。

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的mAP指标比现有方法提高了5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务，贡献了数据集和工具包，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了指尖和手腕关节的重要性，且未解决远端关节误差累积问题，导致姿态估计质量下降。

Method: EHPE分为两个阶段：TW阶段提取指尖和手腕关节，PG阶段通过双分支交互网络优化其余关节位置。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构显著提升了手部姿态估计的精度，解决了误差累积问题。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

Result: 系统支持高质量、多样化的艺术字体生成，适用于单字符和多字符输入，跨语言支持。

Conclusion: WordCraft显著提升了艺术字体合成的交互性，为艺术家和设计师提供了更多创意可能。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别提升4.36%和6.1%的性能。

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在复杂手术视频中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

*Tom Kouwenhoven,Kiana Shahrasbi,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文重新评估了视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在bouba-kiki效应中的表现，发现CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体未能一致体现人类认知中的跨模态关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，测试CLIP的ResNet和ViT模型。

Result: 模型未表现出一致的bouba-kiki效应，且表现远不及人类数据。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类认知不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

TL;DR: Inter2Former通过优化密集令牌处理的计算分配，提出四种关键改进，实现了在CPU设备上高效且高质量的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集令牌方法在精度和细节保留上表现优异，但在CPU设备上处理速度慢；而稀疏令牌方法（如SAM）速度快但分割质量较低。Inter2Former旨在解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE)、Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA)、Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE)和Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU)四种改进，优化计算分配。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former实现了SOTA性能，并在CPU设备上保持高效。

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过自适应计算策略，成功平衡了分割质量和处理速度，为交互式分割领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的问答对，构建FairFaceGPT数据集。

Result: FaceLLM在面部任务中表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 展示了语言模型合成监督在领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，推动了可信、以人为本的多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

TL;DR: FAIR方法通过动态对齐图像特征与语言嵌入，改进了无监督适应中的伪标签生成，显著提升了细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督适应中无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入FAIR方法，通过Class Description Anchors动态对齐特征，提出Learned Alignment Score和改进的自训练机制。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，FAIR比现有方法整体性能提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态对齐和自训练优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this
research is to extract handwritten Hindi characters from an image of Devanagari
script with an automated approach to save time and obsolete data. In this
paper, we present a technique to recognize handwritten Devanagari characters
using two deep convolutional neural network layers. This work employs a
methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%
accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于预训练潜在扩散模型的区域引导、少样本异常图像-掩码对生成框架，解决了现有异常合成方法在真实性、掩码对齐和泛化能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常检测样本稀缺，现有方法在定位和分类任务中效果有限，且现有异常合成方法存在低真实性、掩码对齐不准确和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: GAA利用预训练潜在扩散模型的强先验，通过局部概念分解联合建模异常的语义特征和空间信息，采用自适应多轮异常聚类进行细粒度语义聚类，并通过区域引导掩码生成策略确保异常与掩码的精确对齐。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA框架通过区域引导和少样本生成，显著提升了异常合成的真实性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

TL;DR: 提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过文本对齐光学与SAR图像，提升检索性能54%，并整合地理坐标实现更精准检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的物理信息。

Method: 构建CrisisLandMark数据集，开发CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像嵌入空间，并引入GeoCLOSP整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP提升检索性能54%，GeoCLOSP在位置相关任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理信息的整合对遥感档案的潜力开发至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Method: 构建EmRACE-3K数据集，包含3000多个语言指导任务，并通过监督学习和强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 在零样本设置下，所有模型成功率低于20%，但微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为具身推理能力的发展提供了有效工具，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 解缠技术对减少偏见的效果因模型不同而异，强调了医疗影像AI中公平性的重要性，以确保公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately

To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对令牌压缩方法的统一分类和比较，且未验证其在紧凑型ViT上的有效性。

Method: 提出系统分类法，并在标准和紧凑型ViT上评估代表性令牌压缩技术。

Result: 令牌压缩方法在通用ViT上有效，但在紧凑型设计上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来优化紧凑型Transformer网络提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VSD方法在实践中存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题，论文旨在通过优化顺序和模型线性化改进这些问题。

Method: 提出了线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和使用线性化模型来提高生成质量和训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，$L^2$-VSD在生成质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到其他VSD框架中。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD是一种高效且稳定的改进方法，显著提升了文本到3D生成的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理现实拼图中碎片的几何特性，且依赖碎片形状的限制。

Method: 结合几何和图像信息计算碎片对的最优对齐，并引入新的碎片数据集和侵蚀模型。

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精确度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了碎片兼容性计算的性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判ID样本为OOD的问题，且难以处理匹配多个标签的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除子类别标签和专有名词，并采用动态调整的多匹配感知评分函数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中弱势道路使用者（如行人和骑行者）的安全问题，目前缺乏标准化基准来定量评估MLLMs在复杂、安全关键场景中的推理能力。

Method: 提出VRU-Accident基准，包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选题对和1K密集场景描述，专注于VRU-车辆事故的细粒度标注。

Result: 评估了17种先进MLLMs，发现其在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在安全关键场景中能力的空白，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

Method: 通过实验比较人类和两种深度学习模型（DGCNN和点变换器）在点密度、对象方向和局部几何结构变化下的表现。

Result: 点变换器模型在模拟人类表现上优于卷积神经网络，因其支持3D形状的层次抽象。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型更接近人类的3D形状表征方式，突出了层次抽象机制的重要性。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的高光谱重建方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息转换的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，提取混合码本（MoC）；第二阶段通过查询MoC特征优化RGB到HSI的映射。还引入了灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明MCGA实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过两阶段方法和创新的注意力机制，高效且轻量地实现了高光谱图像重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变性对航空图像目标检测性能有显著提升，多分支头设计有效平衡了参数量和精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and

which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成方法样本重复或简单，无法针对下游模型弱点。

Method: 结合SAFE模块提取目标信息，WASM模块生成难检测样本，反馈下游模型结果。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的AP和78.12%的F1-MAX，息肉数据集上mIoU为81.64%，mDice为87.69%。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能生成多样高质量训练数据，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Motivation: 提升时尚零售中产品属性识别的准确性和效率，以改善客户体验和产品目录管理。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，以图像为唯一输入，评估两种LLM在18类时尚属性上的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: LLM在时尚属性识别中表现有限，需进一步领域微调，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜在光束敏感材料（如蛋白质和二维材料）中的应用受到辐射损伤的限制，需要一种新方法来突破传统电子显微镜的剂量限制。

Method: 结合多图像超分辨率（MISR）和卷积神经网络（CNN），开发了一种双路径、注意力引导的网络，用于4D-STEM，从超低剂量数据中实现原子级超分辨率。

Result: 在超低剂量条件下，该方法实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态光束敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用性强的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖KL散度估计不确定性，忽略了模态间的领域差距，导致多视图融合可靠性不足。

Method: KPHD-Net使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Hölder散度和Dempster-Shafer证据理论，提升不确定性估计效果。

Result: 实验表明KPHD-Net在分类和聚类任务中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性、鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有2D和3D物理攻击在平衡物理真实性和攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，3DGAA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用3D高斯分布的14维参数化，联合优化几何和外观属性，并引入物理过滤和增强模块。

Result: 在虚拟和物理实验中，3DGAA将检测mAP从87.21%降至7.38%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DGAA是一种实用的攻击框架，可用于评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像序列的二项式自补偿方法（I-BSC），用于解决相位移动轮廓测量（PSP）在动态测量中的运动误差问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSP在动态测量中因物体运动导致误差，现有方法P-BSC虽有效但计算开销大且误差累积。

Method: I-BSC通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，仅计算一次反正切函数，降低了计算复杂度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现了准单次帧率，计算速度比P-BSC快数倍至数十倍。

Conclusion: I-BSC显著提升了动态3D扫描的性能，兼具高效与高精度。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态模型构建中需要大量计算资源进行模型选择和连接器训练，Hyma旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，为多种单模态模型组合联合训练连接器模块。

Result: 实验表明，Hyma将最优模型对搜索成本降低10倍，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型对齐解决方案，显著减少了计算负担。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效、高质量的设备端个性化，且不影响推理延迟。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SegFormer的两阶段迁移学习策略，显著提升了遥感图像水体分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像水体分割中领域偏移和小样本量的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段迁移学习策略，先在源域训练基础模型，再在目标域微调。

Result: IoU从25.50%提升至64.84%，显著优于直接迁移。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异导致的性能下降，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效提升了CLIP在长文本任务中的表现，同时保持短文本能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Motivation: 解决多摄像头场景下目标身份一致性分配的挑战。

Method: 使用BoT-SORT进行单摄像头跟踪，通过轨迹特征匹配初始化全局ID，后续采用优先全局匹配策略。

Result: 实现了跨视角目标身份的一致性分配，并通过3D位置估计进行空间验证。

Conclusion: 该框架在多摄像头场景下有效解决了目标身份一致性问题。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures

appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

Motivation: 解决像素级标注成本高的问题，探索基础模型在半监督分割中的有效利用。

Method: 结合无监督掩码变换一致性和CLIP的零样本分类增强识别，利用SAM伪标签进行类无关解码器预热以增强定位。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上仅用158张标注图像，达到29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU，性能优于现有方法且GPU内存需求更低。

Conclusion: DEARLi在半监督场景下表现出色，尤其在标注数据有限和大分类任务中，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Motivation: 传统方法在复杂的超声心动图运动中表现不佳，而现代点跟踪方法在该领域尚未充分探索，因此研究其在超声心动图中的有效性和局限性。

Method: 通过分析心脏运动的方向性偏差，改进了训练策略并引入定制化增强方法，同时提出了一种轻量级网络，利用多尺度成本体积提升跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 尽管某些点跟踪模型在超声心动图中表现有限，但提出的方法在运动估计和临床测量中表现出显著优势，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现更优，仅需两个训练样本即可超越随机性能，而前馈模型需四个。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更适应性和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 双级别域适应方法有效提升了文本人物检索的性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

TL;DR: ECP框架通过两阶段方法提升MLLM在高分辨率图像上的性能，无需训练且任务无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因固定分辨率训练导致细节丢失或泛化能力差。

Method: 提出ECP框架：先通过降采样图像生成候选区域，再基于候选区域预测最终结果。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了MLLM在高分辨率图像上的局限性，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因不平衡优化问题表现不佳，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但本文认为不平衡学习才是最优设置。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差比重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差最小化泛化误差。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，独立于多模态模型结构，能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Result: 研究发现种族背景对微表情识别存在一定影响，并提出了一个考虑种族差异的框架。

Conclusion: 结论认为情绪普遍性假设在种族背景下存在过度泛化，需在微表情分析中考虑种族差异。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 多模态学习中，模态编码器与融合模块的优化冲突导致性能不如单模态学习，现有方法未能解决此问题。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失的反向传播梯度，并用单模态损失的梯度替代，同时移除单模态损失对融合模块的梯度干扰。

Result: 实验表明DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中均有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL成功解决了多模态学习中的优化冲突，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成面临计算成本高和实时性不足的问题，现有方法需要推理时微调或大规模数据集训练。

Method: 采用LoRA层训练，结合衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息损失，并引入选择性主题区域损失以优化生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，能够实现高质量的全身体合成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA是一种高效且实用的个性化图像生成方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了图像生成质量与效率。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法在性能和效率上存在局限，SL旨在通过高维空间建模提升效率和准确性。

Method: SL将2D输入（如图像）提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集（13个语义分割，6个深度估计）上验证，模型参数减少98%以上，推理成本降低，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Motivation: 假肢步态分析对优化设计和提高生活质量至关重要，但现有视觉方法因假肢独特外观和运动模式面临挑战。

Method: 提出ProGait数据集，包含412个视频片段，支持多种视觉任务，并提供了基准任务和微调基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在假肢特定任务中表现优于预训练模型，展示了ProGait的实用性。

Conclusion: ProGait数据集填补了假肢步态分析的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉语言模型在检测OOD样本时，对接近InD数据的挑战性样本仍存在误分类问题。

Method: 利用MLLMs生成边界对齐的合成OOD数据，通过梯度调整噪声，并优化CLIP模型的图像编码器和负标签特征。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界样本和优化模型，显著提升了OOD检测能力，且参数和运行时增加极小。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Result: 通过优化上述因素，AID模型在现实条件下的AUC平均提升了26.87%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AID模型在现实场景中的关键改进方向，为未来技术发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Result: 风格迁移显著减少纹理偏差，提升对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，能有效减少纹理依赖并增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在稀疏输入的物体中心场景中，背景纹理可能显著影响相机姿态估计的准确性，因此需要一种有效的攻击方法。

Method: 引入KBA方法，利用对称纹理形成多视角相似背景，并提出投影方向一致性损失优化纹理。

Result: 实验表明，优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法通过对称背景纹理和优化策略，显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的令牌分配策略，显著提升了Transformer在视觉任务中的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Conclusion: IP-FVR通过创新的身份条件机制和漂移抑制策略，为面部视频恢复提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Motivation: 线性投影器在视频MLLM中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而现有方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: DisCo包含两个模块：视觉概念判别器（VCD）和时间焦点校准器（TFC），分别用于增强语义区分和时间一致性。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM框架和基准测试中，DisCo显著优于现有方法，并提高了标记效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLM提供了一种高效且性能优越的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Conclusion: 双编码器框架有效提升了无注释手语翻译的性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Conclusion: IMD有效解决了视觉基础模型在特征匹配中的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙壁分割性能。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: VRGAdapter为文本适配器提供了一种更通用的解决方案，并通过UMF进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: FG-ZSD是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题，MSHC方法在细粒度检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for

TL;DR: FOCAL是一种测试时数据驱动框架，利用基础模型的互联网规模视觉先验，通过生成和优化候选变换来实现鲁棒感知，无需重新训练或架构更改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法依赖专用架构或预定义增强的局限性，提升视觉感知的泛化能力。

Method: 利用基础模型的视觉先验，生成并优化候选变换，使其趋向视觉典型的“规范”视图。

Result: 实验表明，FOCAL显著提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，为不变性提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

*Aaryam Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合拓扑数据分析（TDA）和深度学习的特征工程方法，显著提升了遥感图像分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像分类中偏向于纹理特征，而TDA能捕捉几何信息，结合两者可提升模型性能。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18结合，用于遥感图像分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上准确率达到99.33%，超过ResNet50等更大模型；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习结合，提升分类性能，扩展了TDA的应用范围。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SC-AGIQA的统一框架，通过文本-视觉语义约束改进AI生成图像的质量评估，解决了语义对齐和细节感知缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估AI生成图像时存在语义对齐和细节感知的不足，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 结合文本辅助语义对齐模块（TSAM）和频域细粒度退化感知模块（FFDPM），利用多模态大语言模型和频域分析提升评估效果。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，SC-AGIQA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点拟合参数模型，但关键点标注费时且不可靠，因此提出无需关键点标注的解决方案。

Method: 引入密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并开发分层对齐策略整合轮廓、部分级、像素级和时间线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基于模型和无模型的基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可支持其他3D任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal在效率和稳定性上表现优异，具有大规模应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

TL;DR: 研究者提出了CoralVQA，首个用于珊瑚礁分析的大规模视觉问答数据集，包含12,805张珊瑚图像和277,653个问答对，旨在解决珊瑚监测中的专业标注和多维问题挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 珊瑚礁是重要但脆弱的生态系统，需要持续监测以支持保护。现有的珊瑚图像分析需要专业知识，而视觉问答（VQA）技术可以提供用户友好的交互方式。

Method: 开发了一个半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家的专业知识，创建了包含多维问题的CoralVQA数据集。

Result: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像的视觉语言推理提供了全面基准，并揭示了当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的关键局限和机会。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为未来LVLM的发展奠定了基础，特别支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的遥感图像融合方法，通过RAPConv和PAN-DFF模块提升空间细节和光谱保真度，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能提升。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制优化空间细节与光谱保真度的平衡。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合，显著提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Motivation: 现有方法在身份保留上存在不足，主要由于对细节纹理的特征引入不当。

Result: 在各种骨干模型上的实验表明，该方法在身份保留和参考特征转移质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: RefSTAR方法有效提升了盲人脸图像恢复的性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 时间戳预测和地理定位相互依赖，现有方法未充分解决这种关系，GT-Loc旨在通过联合优化解决这一问题。

Method: 使用图像、时间和位置的独立编码器，在共享特征空间中对齐嵌入，并提出基于环形表面的时间度量学习目标。

Result: GT-Loc在时间预测上优于现有方法，同时在标准地理定位任务中表现竞争性，嵌入空间支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间预测和地理定位，展示了高效性和多功能性，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Result: NFM-DRA方法在性能上优于现有方法，但对某些未见异常仍存在性能下降。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了视网膜异常检测领域的空白，为未来研究提供了标准化基准和高效方法。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Motivation: 多视角计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，需要有效的方法将视觉标记与3D空间关联。

Method: 比较了三种相机条件化方法：标记级光线映射编码、注意力级相对位姿编码，以及提出的PRoPE（捕捉完整相机参数）。

Result: 实验表明，相对相机条件化提升了新视角合成性能，PRoPE进一步带来增益，且在不同任务和模型规模中均有效。

Conclusion: PRoPE在多视角Transformer中表现优越，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Motivation: 由于对小农农业系统基本属性的理解有限，设计科学政策以提升其可持续性面临挑战。研究旨在通过高分辨率数据和深度学习解决这一问题。

Method: 整合1.5米高分辨率地球观测数据和深度迁移学习技术，生成全国范围的农田边界图，同时减少参考数据需求并提高可迁移性。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克2100万块农田的分布图，准确率达93%，农田规模中位数为0.16公顷，83%的农田小于0.5公顷。农田规模与可达性、人口密度和森林覆盖变化密切相关。

Conclusion: 农田规模是农业社会经济和环境结果（如粮食生产、生计、森林砍伐和生物多样性）及其权衡的关键指标。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练高压缩率的VQ-VAE计算成本高，需要数千GPU小时，ReVQ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过控制量化噪声在VAE容忍范围内，结合通道多组量化和后矫正器，减少量化误差。

Result: ReVQ在单个NVIDIA 4090上22小时完成训练，压缩ImageNet图像至512个token，保持高质量重建（rFID=1.06）。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量间取得优异平衡，计算成本降低两个数量级。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

### [161] [Spatial ModernBERT: Spatial-Aware Transformer for Table and Key-Value Extraction in Financial Documents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08865)
*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型Spatial ModernBERT，结合空间嵌入技术，用于从复杂财务文档中准确提取表格和键值对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 模型通过三个分类头（标签头、列头和行头）进行标记分类，并在PubTables-1M数据集上预训练后微调，结合后处理方法重建表格布局和提取键值对。

Result: 实验表明，Spatial ModernBERT能有效利用文本和空间线索，在真实财务文档中实现高精度的提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT为财务文档中的表格和键值对提取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在解决现有护栏在多语言安全对齐上的不足，通过LoRA适配多语言模型，并在SEALSBench数据集上表现优于LlamaGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入上表现不佳，导致LLM系统在低资源语言中易受攻击。

Method: 采用低秩适配（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建SEALSBench数据集（26万条多语言提示）。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测上优于LlamaGuard，DSR提升48%，且在所有指标（DSR、精度、F1）上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效的多语言护栏显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在临床真实性、透明性和验证过程上存在不足，需要更严谨、无偏且能反映临床复杂性的评估工具。

Method: 通过审查MedQA、MedMCQA、PubMedQA和MMLU等常用数据集，并分析医学期刊中的挑战问题，评估其优缺点。

Result: 发现现有数据集缺乏临床现实性和透明度，而挑战问题虽有一定优势，但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLM训练数据覆盖。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立标准化评估框架，并通过多方合作开发更全面、安全的代表性数据集。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIMS是一种无需外部监督的自改进模型引导框架，通过自主生成和优化对比样本，提升大型语言模型（LLM）的引导效果和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了其适应性和效果。SIMS旨在解决这一问题，实现无需外部监督的自适应引导。

Method: SIMS通过自改进循环生成和优化对比样本，并结合提示排名和对比采样等策略增强引导效果。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准测试中，SIMS显著优于现有方法，展现了更高的引导效果和适应性。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理时对齐研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，电子健康记录（EHR）中存在对特定患者群体的污名化语言，尤其是黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者，且不同医疗提供者表现出类似模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨EHR中污名化语言的普遍性及其对患者的影响。

Method: 通过扩展词典匹配和监督学习分类器识别MIMIC-III EHR中的怀疑标记和污名化标签，并使用泊松回归模型分析预测因素。

Result: 黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者的污名化标签率更高，护士和社会工作者的使用率也较高。

Conclusion: 污名化语言在历史上被污名化的患者中更常见，需采取措施减少其影响。

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉系统生成能力在Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉中表现出个体差异，强想象者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象者描述简单几何模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉系统个体差异（如想象能力）如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具分析4000多名参与者的幻觉描述，结合视觉语言模型和文本语言模型。

Result: 强想象者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象者描述简单几何模式；视觉语言模型更能捕捉差异。

Conclusion: 个体在视觉区域和高阶区域协调上的差异可能与想象能力谱系相关。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard是一个线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大语言模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在上下文长度增加时面临内存和计算瓶颈，Lizard旨在通过次二次注意力机制解决这一问题。

Method: Lizard引入次二次注意力机制，结合门控模块和混合机制（全局压缩与局部滑动窗口），并优化训练算法。

Result: Lizard在语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，在MMLU基准上提升18分，并在关联召回任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Lizard通过灵活的次二次架构和门控设计，显著提升了长上下文生成能力，优于现有线性化方法。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

TL;DR: ALIGN系统通过基于提示的对齐方法，动态个性化LLM决策者，支持多属性分析和模块化算法集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM比较工具主要关注基准任务，而用户多样化的价值观和偏好需要新的对齐和个性化方法。

Method: ALIGN系统采用提示对齐方法，支持结构化输出生成、配置管理和可交换LLM后端，提供定性和定量分析。

Result: 系统在公共意见调查和医疗分诊决策两个领域进行了定量对齐分析，并开源了框架。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架为可靠、负责任和个性化的LLM决策者研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Motivation: 大规模高质量数据集对代码生成与评价的进展至关重要，现有数据集规模不足。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略：首阶段专注于代码生成，次阶段联合训练代码生成与评价。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型在代码生成上表现优异，联合训练显著提升竞赛编程性能。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集和两阶段微调策略为代码推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在处理长音频序列时因高帧率导致的上下文窗口限制问题，显著提升了语音情感识别（SER）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理和理解能力，现有方法忽视了情感在对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，通过上下文语义和句子级情感编码，将信息逐步编码到临时LoRA模块中，以处理无限长度音频。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM处理长音频序列时的情感识别能力，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效解决了SLLM的上下文窗口限制问题，为长音频情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

Motivation: 解决传统扫描教材可能带来的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成的支持内容显著提高了模型的准确性，尤其是对晶体学知识有限的模型。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了开卷系统在材料科学中的实用性，并为科学领域的自然语言处理工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中欺骗检测因语言微妙性和类别不平衡而复杂且高风险，需高效且针对性的解决方案。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释语言和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标，专为少量标记欺骗消息设计。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上达到0.60的宏F1，参数减少650倍，验证了PU学习、可解释性和说话者感知表示的价值。

Conclusion: 在欺骗检测中，准确识别欺骗比识别真实消息更重要，PU学习能有效建模稀有但关键的欺骗类别。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于剪枝的微调方法，通过识别并剪除与数据集特定机制相关的神经元，提升大语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常依赖数据集特定机制，导致在新任务或分布上性能下降，需提升其泛化能力。

Method: 使用Integrated Gradients量化神经元对高置信度预测的影响，剪除与数据集特定机制相关的神经元。

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，该方法显著提升性能，优于非剪枝的适应方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝微调方法有效增强模型泛化能力，适用于提升大语言模型的适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

Motivation: 解决藏语作为低资源语言在现有模型中的代表性不足问题。

Method: 构建最大藏语预训练语料库，并通过专门的数据清洗和处理流程优化数据，随后预训练多语言基础模型为Banzhida。

Result: Banzhida在多项任务中显著优于同类开源模型和针对藏语的定制模型。

Conclusion: Banzhida模型成功提升了藏语生成能力，为低资源语言研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了视觉隐喻（如将冰川融化描绘为融化的冰手榴弹）在气候变化传播中的效果，发现其虽认知负荷较高，但能引发更积极的审美和认知体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中的实际效果，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 创建MetaClimage数据库，收集人类对视觉隐喻和字面图像的评分（难度、效能、艺术质量、情感唤起等），并通过自然语言处理分析标签的语义和情感。

Result: 视觉隐喻比字面图像更难理解但更美观，效能和情感唤起无差异；高认知需求者对视觉隐喻的情感唤起更高；视觉隐喻引发更多标签和更积极的词汇。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻虽增加认知负荷，但能促进更深层次的认知加工和积极体验，为环境传播提供了权衡考量。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在幽默翻译中存在语言干扰和缺乏幽默感的问题，需要改进。

Method: 采用HDM机制，结合CoT模仿人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论优化翻译文本。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在幽默性、流畅性和连贯性上分别平均提升了7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM有效提升了幽默翻译的质量，为跨文化交流提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech在提升语音识别准确性和隐私保护方面表现出色，适用于低数据环境。

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15

Result: 现有方法在不同任务中表现不一，无单一方法全面领先，且方法性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来语言模型数据归因研究提供了基础，并发布了公开排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Conclusion: 优化模型在医疗术语和临床观察方面表现优异，具有广泛医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter
tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key
modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Motivation: 现有讽刺生成研究依赖文本模态且忽视视觉线索，导致图像内容与讽刺意图不匹配，因此需要多模态数据集和方法。

Method: 提出M2SaG数据集（4,970样本）和ViSP框架，结合PPO和对比学习优化生成文本的讽刺意图。

Result: ViSP在五个指标上超越基线模型，生成文本的讽刺评分（0.898 vs. 0.770）和事实不一致性（0.768 vs. 0.739）更高。

Conclusion: ViSP能生成更高质量的讽刺内容，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly

Motivation: 解决ABSA任务中短文本、数据量小且不平衡的问题，尤其是正样本过多的情况。

Method: 利用LLM生成增强数据以平衡标签分布，并通过强化学习优化数据质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了ABSA性能，尤其在数据不平衡场景下。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统缺乏协调性、记忆复用和任务分解能力，难以满足现代企业复杂动态任务的需求。

Method: GoalfyMax基于Model Context Protocol（MCP）构建A2A通信层，采用Experience Pack（XP）架构实现分层记忆，并集成多轮对话、长短时记忆模块和动态安全验证。

Result: 在复杂任务编排基准测试和案例研究中，GoalfyMax展现出优于基线框架的适应性、协调性和经验复用能力。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Motivation: 长上下文引用任务（LCLMs将兴趣项归因于长上下文数据的特定部分）尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计Ref-Long基准，要求LCLMs识别引用特定关键词的文档索引，强调上下文关系而非简单检索。构建三个子集（从合成到现实场景）进行实验。

Conclusion: Ref-Long基准揭示了LCLMs在长上下文引用任务上的不足，并通过分析和实验提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Conclusion: 提示质量对LLM性能至关重要，错误类型和数量是关键因素，但LLM在极端噪声下仍具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

*Daniela Kazakouskaya,Timothee Mickus,Janine Siewert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用现有模型为白俄罗斯语生成定义，提出了一个包含43,150条定义的新数据集，并发现适应定义建模系统所需数据量较少，但自动指标存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过定义建模任务支持更多语言和方言，协助词典编纂工作，尤其是针对尚未支持的语言如白俄罗斯语。

Method: 提出一个包含43,150条定义的白俄罗斯语数据集，并评估现有模型在该语言上的适应性。

Result: 实验表明，适应定义建模系统所需数据量较少，但自动指标未能完全捕捉模型表现。

Conclusion: 定义建模系统对白俄罗斯语的适应性良好，但需改进自动评估指标以更全面反映模型性能。

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet
unsupported languages. In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to
Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

### [192] [NMIXX: Domain-Adapted Neural Embeddings for Cross-Lingual eXploration of Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09601)
*Hanwool Lee,Sara Yu,Yewon Hwang,Jonghyun Choi,Heejae Ahn,Sungbum Jung,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX是一种针对金融领域的跨语言句子嵌入模型，通过微调高置信度三元组提升金融语义捕捉能力，并在韩语和英语金融STS任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型在金融领域和低资源语言（如韩语）中表现不佳，主要由于领域术语、语义漂移和双语词汇不对齐。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，基于18.8K高置信度三元组（领域内释义、语义漂移负样本和韩英翻译对）进行微调，并发布KorFinSTS基准。

Result: NMIXX在英语和韩语金融STS任务中分别提升0.10和0.22的Spearman's rho，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS为金融领域的多语言表示学习提供了有效工具，同时强调了分词设计在低资源跨语言场景中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

*Salvatore Citraro,Edith Haim,Alessandra Carini,Cynthia S. Q. Siew,Giulio Rossetti,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpreadPy是一个用于模拟认知单层和多层网络中激活传播的Python库，支持研究认知过程的结构-功能关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发SpreadPy旨在通过数值模拟研究认知、心理和临床现象中的激活动态，并与知识建模理论进行比较。

Method: SpreadPy通过模拟激活传播，分析认知网络中的结构-功能关系，支持使用经验或理论网络建模。

Result: 三个案例研究表明SpreadPy能区分数学焦虑学生的概念组织差异、揭示认知负荷对词汇访问的影响，以及将失语症患者的网络结构与临床错误类型关联。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供了可重复的研究工具，支持对个体差异和认知障碍的机制研究。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索知识编辑在形态丰富的语言（如阿拉伯语）中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估了ROME、MEMIT、ICE和LTE四种方法在阿拉伯语翻译数据集上的表现，并扩展了LTE到多语言环境。

Result: 参数化方法在跨语言泛化上表现较差，而指令调优方法更稳健；多语言联合训练提升了编辑和迁移能力。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语知识编辑的研究为未来工作提供了基准和多语言训练数据，支持进一步探索。

Abstract: While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its
behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined.
In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods
(ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact
benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support
future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于GRPO的方法，显著提升了泰语法律问答系统中LLM的法律引用准确性和回答质量，同时降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泰语法律问答系统中RAG的性能有限，尤其是在需要复杂法律推理的问题上。

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合BGE-M3嵌入作为语义相似性奖励，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO实现了90%的引用F1提升和31%的联合质量指标提升，且在复杂法律推理任务中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升泰语法律LLM提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

### [196] [MCEval: A Dynamic Framework for Fair Multilingual Cultural Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09701)
*Shulin Huang,Linyi Yang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCEval是一个多语言文化评估框架，通过动态文化问题构建和因果分析，评估大型语言模型的文化意识和偏见，覆盖13种文化和语言，揭示性能差异和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其在全球多样化用户群体中表现明显。

Method: 提出MCEval框架，采用动态文化问题构建、反事实重述和混杂重述进行因果分析，评估13种文化和语言的文化意识和偏见。

Result: 实验结果显示不同语言场景下的性能差异，文化表现与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，并暴露公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供深入洞察。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

*Baturay Saglam,Paul Kassianik,Blaine Nelson,Sajana Weerawardhena,Yaron Singer,Amin Karbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的潜在空间几何结构中，高层语义信息集中在低维子空间，且在不同领域中形成线性可分表示。这种可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持开发基于几何的工具来检测和防御有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs潜在空间的几何结构有助于解释其行为并改进对齐性，但目前尚不清楚LLMs内部如何组织与语义理解相关的表示。

Method: 通过对11个基于Transformer的LLMs进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 发现高层语义信息集中在低维子空间，可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持简单有效的因果干预。

Conclusion: 研究支持开发基于几何的工具，如潜在空间护栏，以检测和防御有害内容，展示了轻量级MLP分类器的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

*Qi Feng,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应的课程学习范式，利用预训练语言模型预测样本难度，并通过不同训练策略优化微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标，可能无法准确反映模型视角，因此需要一种自适应方法。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型预测样本难度，探索从易到难、从难到易及混合采样的训练策略。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，方法比随机采样收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: 自适应课程学习能有效提升模型训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

*Gabriel Mordecki,Guillermo Moncecchi,Javier Couto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文重新定义了点击诱饵（clickbait），提出好奇心缺口是其核心特征，并创建了首个西班牙语点击诱饵检测开源数据集TA1C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点击诱饵的定义缺乏共识，研究旨在明确其与类似现象的区别，并提供更客观的检测标准。

Method: 通过细化概念界限和标注标准，减少主观性，创建并发布了TA1C数据集，包含3,500条手动标注的推文。

Result: 数据集达到0.825的Fleiss' K评分，基线模型F1得分为0.84。

Conclusion: 研究为点击诱饵检测提供了更清晰的定义和高质量数据集，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

*Qinyuan Ye,Robin Jia,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过分析大语言模型在反事实任务中的表现，揭示了其任务级泛化能力的内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型如何通过上下文学习执行未见任务，特别是反事实任务（如‘错位加法’）的内部机制。

Method: 使用路径修补等电路风格可解释性技术，分析模型在错位加法任务中的内部计算。

Result: 发现了一种函数归纳机制，该机制由多个注意力头并行控制，并能推广到其他任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可重用和可组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

*Hai Toan Nguyen,Tien Dat Nguyen,Viet Ha Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进RAG系统的方法，通过分层文本分割和聚类生成更有语义意义的文本块，提升了检索的精确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 结合分层文本分割和聚类，生成更语义连贯的文本块，并利用段和簇级别的向量表示进行检索。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上表现优于传统分块技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果，适用于需要精确和上下文相关信息的场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

TL;DR: TinyRM是一种小型双向掩码语言模型（MLM），参数仅4亿，性能媲美175倍大的模型，适用于奖励建模任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着奖励模型在测试时策略中的广泛应用，其推理成本成为关注焦点。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、定向低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术，在RewardBench上表现优异。

Result: TinyRM在推理和安全偏好建模任务中表现强劲，资源消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 轻量级双向架构有望成为高效、可扩展的偏好建模替代方案。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

TL;DR: TextOmics是一个开创性基准，通过建立组学表达与分子文本描述的一一对应关系，促进分子生成。基于此，提出的ToDi框架结合组学和文本描述生成生物相关、化学有效的分子，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决靶向药物发现中缺乏异质数据和统一框架的问题。

Method: 引入TextOmics基准和ToDi框架，利用组学和文本描述的双编码器（OmicsEn和TextEn）及条件扩散模型（DiffGen）生成分子。

Result: 实验证明TextOmics的有效性，ToDi在零样本治疗分子生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了新工具，展示了分子生成的潜力。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新框架，通过联合学习风险因素和保护因素对自杀风险的动态影响，预测后续自杀风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注风险因素，忽略了保护因素的作用，且未能捕捉自杀风险的快速波动。

Method: 构建了一个包含风险和保护因素的新型数据集，并提出动态因素影响学习方法。

Result: 实验表明，该模型显著优于现有模型，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床干预提供了更精准的工具，有助于理解自杀模式。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的计算需求高，部署和使用受限，模型压缩是解决这一问题的关键。现有方法如结构化剪枝成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: GeLaCo采用进化方法，通过层折叠和基于群体的搜索，结合模块相似性适应度函数（注意力、前馈和隐藏状态表示），支持单目标和多目标优化。

Result: GeLaCo在困惑度和生成评估中优于现有方法，首次建立了压缩与质量之间的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）未能代表多样化的文化道德框架，尽管其具备语言能力。模型在19种文化背景下与人类道德直觉存在显著差距，且模型规模的增加并未改善文化代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真实代表人类价值观，而非简单地平均化。

Method: 通过在不同文化背景下应用道德基础问卷，比较多个先进LLMs与人类基线数据的差异。

Result: LLMs系统性地同质化道德多样性，模型规模的增加未能提升文化代表性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLMs作为合成人群在社会科学研究中的应用，并指出当前AI对齐方法的局限性，呼吁更接地气的对齐目标和评估指标。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Qinyu Liu,Jun Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM和Transformer的新架构，用于时间序列预测，融合了语义和时间动态信息，提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因其擅长处理离散文本而非连续数值数据，而传统Transformer缺乏语义理解能力。

Method: 设计了一种Transformer架构，融合LLM的高层语义表示和Transformer的时间动态编码，生成混合表示。

Result: 实验证明该方法在基准数据集上有效，预测更准确。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和Transformer的优势，解决了语义和时间动态信息的融合问题，提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需额外参数的任务特征蒸馏方法，解决传统特征蒸馏中师生模型隐藏层尺寸不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法假设师生模型隐藏层尺寸相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性，且线性投影方法会引入额外参数并降低性能。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活值蒸馏到学生模型，无需额外参数。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务中，性能比线性投影基线提升高达3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，适用于不同任务，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

TL;DR: 研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在将辱骂性文本转化为非辱骂性文本时的表现，评估了Gemini、GPT-4o、DeepSeek和Groq等模型的能力，发现Groq与其他模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在处理辱骂性文本的分类与转化方面仍有待探索。

Method: 使用LLMs将包含仇恨言论和脏话的辱骂性文本转化为非辱骂性文本，同时保留文本意图，并通过情感分析和语义分析评估原始与转化后的数据集。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型（如GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3）差异显著，后两者表现相似。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在文本转化任务中表现不一，Groq与其他模型差异明显，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Method: 开发包含18,000多个多选题的Absher基准，涵盖六类任务，评估多种LLM模型。

Result: 发现LLM在文化和语境理解任务上表现不佳，存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调需要方言感知训练和文化对齐评估方法，以提升LLM在阿拉伯应用中的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化搜索的自动离散提示优化方法，用于解决复杂任务中提示设计对小模型的敏感性，并在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务中提示设计对小模型的敏感性，以及现有方法在优化大量文本时的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索方法：第一阶段使用语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序；第二阶段通过局部搜索优化性能。

Result: 在三个小型通用LLM和四个领域特定任务中，优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务中表现优异，性能提升显著，且性能下降极少。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Growth Bound Matrices（GBM）的新正则化技术，用于提升NLP模型对对抗性攻击（如同义词替换）的鲁棒性，特别针对LSTM、S4和CNN架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP模型取得进展，但对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性仍不足，尤其是对递归网络和现代状态空间模型（如S4）的研究较少。

Method: 通过计算GBM来减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响，重点分析了LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗性鲁棒性上比现有基线提高了8.8%，并在对抗防御中优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型的鲁棒性，特别是在对抗性攻击和干净文本上的表现均有显著改进。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于验证LLMs（如GPT-4）是否能复制人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，以评估其作为研究工具的可靠性。

Method: 方法包括四项心理语言学实验（情感意义生成、情感变化、情感语境中的动词选择、句子与表情符号关联），先由人类参与者完成，再由LLM复现。

Result: 结果显示人类与AI反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下存在微小差异，但不影响整体解释。

Conclusion: 结论支持LLMs作为语言学研究中可信赖的协作工具，能够扩展研究规模而不损害解释有效性。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层隐喻处理模型，将意义分为内容分析、概念混合和语用意三个层次，为计算系统提供了更丰富的隐喻解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻意义并非简单的概念映射，而是复杂的认知现象，需要多层次的解释框架。

Method: 采用三层模型：内容分析、概念混合和语用意，逐步解析隐喻的深层意义。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更全面、语境敏感的隐喻理解方法。

Conclusion: 分层框架为隐喻的计算表示奠定了基础，支持更深层次和语境相关的推理。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: LLMs能够从属性图中成功提取子结构，如分子图。

Conclusion: 序列化Transformer在子结构提取任务中表现出色，为图数据处理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在异步任务导向对话中提出澄清问题的能力，以及其与人类行为的差异。

Method: 结合Minecraft Dialogue Corpus的两种注释，构建新语料库，比较LLMs与人类在模糊性情况下的提问行为。

Result: 人类很少为指代模糊提问，但常为任务不确定性提问；LLMs则相反。推理能力可能提升LLMs提问的频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的提问能力可能依赖于其推理能力，但与人类行为相关性较低。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Result: MLAR处理2400份简历时，平均每份耗时5.4秒，比主流RPA平台快约16.9%-17.1%。

Conclusion: MLAR为现代招聘需求提供了高效、准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and
scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

Method: 使用2000个样本，系统比较了LLaDA和LLaMA生成文本的风格指标（如困惑度、爆发性、词汇多样性等）。

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和爆发性上接近人类文本，导致现有检测器高漏检率；LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。

Conclusion: 需开发针对扩散模型的检测方法，如混合模型、扩散特定风格特征或鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注参数共享或自适应计算，但未同时解决两者，MoR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MoR通过共享层和轻量级路由器实现参数效率和自适应计算，动态分配递归深度并选择性缓存KV对。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数的模型规模中，MoR在相同训练FLOPs下显著降低困惑度，提高few-shot准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR是一种在不增加大模型成本的情况下实现高质量模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

TL;DR: REST框架通过同时测试多个问题评估大型推理模型，揭示现有基准测试的局限性，并展示更强的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅评估单问题推理，无法反映多上下文压力下的真实推理需求，且易受数据污染影响。

Method: 提出REST框架，同时暴露模型于多个问题，评估上下文优先级分配、跨问题干扰抵抗和动态认知负载管理能力。

Result: SOTA模型在压力测试下表现显著下降，REST显示更强区分能力，揭示模型间的性能差异。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，更贴近真实推理需求，减少对人标注的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

*Simon Schwaiger,Stefan Thalhammer,Wilfried Wöber,Gerald Steinbauer-Wagner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OTAS提出了一种开放词汇标记对齐方法，用于户外分割，通过直接从预训练视觉模型的输出标记中提取语义结构，克服了开放词汇分割模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开放世界语义对机器人规划和控制在非结构化户外环境中的重要性，现有方法因语义模糊和类边界不清晰而表现不佳。

Method: OTAS通过聚类单视图和多视图中的语义相似结构，并将其与语言对齐，构建几何一致的特征场，支持开放词汇分割查询。

Result: OTAS在零样本场景下运行，无需场景特定微调，速度达17 fps，在多个数据集上优于现有方法，3D分割性能提升达151%。

Conclusion: OTAS适用于机器人应用，代码和ROS节点将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Understanding open-world semantics is critical for robotic planning and
control, particularly in unstructured outdoor environments. Current
vision-language mapping approaches rely on object-centric segmentation priors,
which often fail outdoors due to semantic ambiguities and indistinct semantic
class boundaries. We propose OTAS - an Open-vocabulary Token Alignment method
for Outdoor Segmentation. OTAS overcomes the limitations of open-vocabulary
segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly from the output
tokens of pretrained vision models. By clustering semantically similar
structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in language,
OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that supports
open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates zero-shot, without
scene-specific fine-tuning, and runs at up to ~17 fps. OTAS provides a minor
IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D segmentation methods on
the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset. Our model achieves up to a 151% IoU
improvement over open-vocabulary mapping methods in 3D segmentation on
TartanAir. Real-world reconstructions demonstrate OTAS' applicability to
robotic applications. The code and ROS node will be made publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions
in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied

present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom
aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current
visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for
aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention
pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone
actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent
annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase
training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied
spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion
intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

Abstract: High-precision vectorized maps are indispensable for autonomous driving, yet
traditional LiDAR-based creation is costly and slow, while single-vehicle
perception methods lack accuracy and robustness, particularly in adverse
conditions. This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that
overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps
through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior
approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements
perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture
within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for
efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly
enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle
baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP
demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution
for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation
costs.

Motivation: 传统车辆方法在复杂交叉路口的高清语义映射中存在遮挡和视角限制的问题，因此需要一种基于路边单元的多模态解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段融合框架，结合摄像头的高分辨率纹理和LiDAR的精确几何数据，通过模态特定特征提取和跨模态语义集成实现。

Result: 在RS-seq数据集上，多模态方法的平均交并比（mIoU）比仅用图像的方法提高了4%，比仅用点云的方法提高了18%。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Result: 提出了一种高效的强化学习框架，显著提升了多指手操作的灵巧性。

Conclusion: 通过结合强化学习和模仿学习，论文为机器人实现人类级灵巧操作提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with
multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and
emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox,
dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many
million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich
tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long
been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward
general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor
learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary
in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels
of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational
sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause.
Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an
effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered
manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively
overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The
insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that
incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this
thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for
dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合包装策略、结构稳定性验证和启发式规划的新框架，解决在线装箱问题中结构稳定性和安全重新配置的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在在线装箱问题中虽能提高体积利用率，但无法确保结构稳定性且缺乏安全重新配置机制。

Method: 引入负载可承受凸多边形（LBCP）概念和稳定重排规划（SRP）模块，分别用于高效验证稳定加载位置和规划安全重排。

Result: 在标准OBPP基准测试中，LBCP验证高效且通用，SRP在节省重排成本方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业和物流中的自动化装箱提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) is a sequential decision-making task in
which each item must be placed immediately upon arrival, with no knowledge of
future arrivals. Although recent deep-reinforcement-learning methods achieve
superior volume utilization compared with classical heuristics, the learned
policies cannot ensure the structural stability of the bin and lack mechanisms
for safely reconfiguring the bin when a new item cannot be placed directly. In
this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates packing policy with
structural stability validation and heuristic planning to overcome these
limitations. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Load Bearable Convex
Polygon (LBCP), which provides a computationally efficient way to identify
stable loading positions that guarantee no bin collapse. Additionally, we
present Stable Rearrangement Planning (SRP), a module that rearranges existing
items to accommodate new ones while maintaining overall stability. Extensive
experiments on standard OBPP benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and
generalizability of our LBCP-based stability validation, as well as the
superiority of SRP in finding the effort-saving rearrangement plans. Our method
offers a robust and practical solution for automated packing in real-world
industrial and logistics applications.

Conclusion: Tactile-VLA成功将VLA模型的隐式知识扩展到物理交互领域，为通用机器人代理的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements,
driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components.
However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into
physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained
force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond
identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real
world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses
vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a
hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into
precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt
its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's
effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling
tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant
commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key
finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic
understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile
sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to
achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量机器人任务，适用于强化学习训练和任务相似性分析。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for the procedural construction of multi-step
contact-rich manipulation tasks in robotics. Our generator takes as input
user-defined sets of atomic actions, objects, and spatial predicates and
outputs solvable tasks of a given length for the selected robotic environment.
The generator produces solvable tasks by constraining all possible
(nonsolvable) combinations by symbolic and physical validation. The symbolic
validation checks each generated sequence for logical and operational
consistency, and also the suitability of object-predicate relations. Physical
validation checks whether tasks can be solved in the selected robotic
environment. Only the tasks that passed both validators are retained. The
output from the generator can be directly interfaced with any existing
framework for training robotic manipulation tasks, or it can be stored as a
dataset of curated robotic tasks with detailed information about each task.
This is beneficial for RL training as there are dense reward functions and
initial and goal states paired with each subgoal. It allows the user to measure
the semantic similarity of all generated tasks. We tested our generator on
sequences of up to 15 actions resulting in millions of unique solvable
multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需基础设施或人工调参，开源代码可用，为多LiDAR标定提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

We propose HZ-MP, an informed Hybrid Zonotope-based Motion Planner, as an
alternative approach that decomposes the obstacle-free space and performs
low-dimensional face sampling guided by an ellipsotope heuristic, enabling
focused exploration along promising transit regions. This structured
exploration eliminates the excessive, unreachable sampling that degrades
existing informed planners such as AIT* and EIT* in narrow gaps or boxed-goal

optimal. It converges to near-optimal trajectories in finite time and scales to
high-dimensional cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: RMRP和RPATR框架为高速无人机和地面机器人提供了计算高效且安全的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in mobile robots, reliant on perception and planning,
faces major hurdles in large-scale, complex environments. These include heavy
computational burdens for mapping, sensor occlusion failures for UAVs, and
traversal challenges on irregular terrain for UGVs, all compounded by a lack of
perception-aware strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce Random
Mapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight
linear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,
followed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel
Residual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this
process, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this
map, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)
framework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance
Field (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to
refine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a
closed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP
model's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive
navigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form
gradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in
diverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in
time, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe
navigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster
community collaboration.

Method: 引入C-ZUPT方法，通过不确定性阈值识别准静态平衡，提供精确速度更新。

Result: C-ZUPT显著减少惯性漂移和控制能耗，提升导航稳定性，延长飞行时间。

Conclusion: C-ZUPT为资源受限的空中系统提供高效导航解决方案，增强飞行稳定性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for
drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and
cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many
environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors,
leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise.
To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information
aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update
(ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during
stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This
work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and
control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold,
C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates
to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these
opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and
control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances
navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially
extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial
systems.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging.
Synthesizing stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing
task performance and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on
expert demonstrations closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical
demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to
boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we
propose formulating the problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP). Specifically, we optimize a style-imitation objective with constraints
to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively
adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks,
demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On
ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile
gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning
framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential
fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our
approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling
efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The
framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local
potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic
scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model
and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation,
demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial
pursuer observability.

Abstract: Flying multiple quadrotors in close proximity presents a significant
challenge due to complex aerodynamic interactions, particularly downwash
effects that are known to destabilize vehicles and degrade performance.
Traditionally, multi-quadrotor systems rely on conservative strategies, such as
collision avoidance zones around the robot volume, to circumvent this effect.
This restricts their capabilities by requiring a large volume for the operation
of a multi-quadrotor system, limiting their applicability in dense
environments. This work provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the
downwash effect, with a focus on characterizing, analyzing, and understanding
forces, moments, and velocities in both single and multi-quadrotor
configurations. We use measurements of forces and torques to characterize
vehicle interactions, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the
spatial features of the downwash wake for a single quadrotor and an interacting
pair of quadrotors. This data can be used to inform physics-based strategies
for coordination, leverage downwash for optimized formations, expand the
envelope of operation, and improve the robustness of multi-quadrotor control.

Motivation: 无人机在测试和开发中需要精确建模，但传统方法成本高或精度不足，因此开发低成本、高精度的数据驱动建模工具。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving
the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper
proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of
cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently
processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor
fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model
visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion
Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is
determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which
provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and
the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to
get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data
from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously
update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result
shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with
high degree of accuracy and fluidity

Result: 实际实验表明，mmE-Loc在精度和延迟上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: mmE-Loc系统通过传感器融合和优化模块，实现了无人机精准降落的高效解决方案。

Abstract: For precise, efficient, and safe drone landings, ground platforms should
real-time, accurately locate descending drones and guide them to designated
spots. While mmWave sensing combined with cameras improves localization
accuracy, lower sampling frequency of traditional frame cameras compared to
mmWave radar creates bottlenecks in system throughput. In this work, we upgrade
traditional frame camera with event camera, a novel sensor that harmonizes in
sampling frequency with mmWave radar within ground platform setup, and
introduce mmE-Loc, a high-precision, low-latency ground localization system
designed for precise drone landings. To fully exploit the \textit{temporal
consistency} and \textit{spatial complementarity} between these two modalities,
we propose two innovative modules: \textit{(i)} the Consistency-instructed
Collaborative Tracking module, which further leverages the drone's physical
knowledge of periodic micro-motions and structure for accurate measurements
extraction, and \textit{(ii)} the Graph-informed Adaptive Joint Optimization
module, which integrates drone motion information for efficient sensor fusion
and drone localization. Real-world experiments conducted in landing scenarios
with a drone delivery company demonstrate that mmE-Loc significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: TruckV2X填补了重型车辆协同感知数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Autonomous trucking offers significant benefits, such as improved safety and
reduced costs, but faces unique perception challenges due to trucks' large size
and dynamic trailer movements. These challenges include extensive blind spots
and occlusions that hinder the truck's perception and the capabilities of other
road users. To address these limitations, cooperative perception emerges as a
promising solution. However, existing datasets predominantly feature light
vehicle interactions or lack multi-agent configurations for heavy-duty vehicle
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruckV2X, the first large-scale
truck-centered cooperative perception dataset featuring multi-modal sensing
(LiDAR and cameras) and multi-agent cooperation (tractors, trailers, CAVs, and
RSUs). We further investigate how trucks influence collaborative perception
needs, establishing performance benchmarks while suggesting research priorities
for heavy vehicle perception. The dataset provides a foundation for developing
cooperative perception systems with enhanced occlusion handling capabilities,
and accelerates the deployment of multi-agent autonomous trucking systems. The

Result: 在大规模数据集上，Plan-MAE在规划指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Plan-MAE可作为基于学习的运动规划器的重要预训练步骤。

Abstract: Predicting the future of surrounding agents and accordingly planning a safe,
goal-directed trajectory are crucial for automated vehicles. Current methods
typically rely on imitation learning to optimize metrics against the ground
truth, often overlooking how scene understanding could enable more holistic
trajectories. In this paper, we propose Plan-MAE, a unified pretraining
framework for prediction and planning that capitalizes on masked autoencoders.
Plan-MAE fuses critical contextual understanding via three dedicated tasks:
reconstructing masked road networks to learn spatial correlations, agent
trajectories to model social interactions, and navigation routes to capture
destination intents. To further align vehicle dynamics and safety constraints,
we incorporate a local sub-planning task predicting the ego-vehicle's near-term
trajectory segment conditioned on earlier segment. This pretrained model is
subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks to jointly generate the prediction
and planning trajectories. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that
Plan-MAE outperforms current methods on the planning metrics by a large margin
and can serve as an important pre-training step for learning-based motion
planner.

Result: 通过调整SNN中LIF神经元的膜泄漏常数，实现了与CNN相当的机器人控制精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明SNN在机器人避障中具有潜力，并开源了LIDAR数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much
attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity
inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs
well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers)
where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context,
this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and
obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a
LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together
with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance.
Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN
precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that
by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to
achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during
this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future
research.

Conclusion: IteraOptiRacing策略在多车竞争场景中表现优异，适用于实时自动驾驶赛车。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with
other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments.
This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the
presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's
historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost
optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in
collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's
constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable
real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its
performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with
multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated
autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing
car.

Conclusion: 该系统在资源有限的情况下（8 Hz处理频率，32x32像素视图，内存占用<9 kB），提供了一种生物启发的、高效的视觉归巢解决方案。

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态预测和主动探测方面表现出色，适用于现实世界的自主导航挑战。

Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

Result: 在真实交通场景中，MRMEL比基线方法额外减少了4%-9%的车辆排放。

Conclusion: MRMEL为复杂交通环境下的自动驾驶控制提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their
applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as
mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts
with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is
referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective
Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic
scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are
highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such
diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint
complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among
participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict
physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce
Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for
Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with
a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic
scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement
learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a
residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable
nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic
scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case
study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas
Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.
The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving
an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the
strongest baseline in each setting.

Conclusion: AdvGrasp为机器人抓取的鲁棒性评估和改进提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on robotic grasping provide valuable insights into
evaluating and improving the robustness of these systems. Unlike studies that
focus solely on neural network predictions while overlooking the physical
principles of grasping, this paper introduces AdvGrasp, a framework for
adversarial attacks on robotic grasping from a physical perspective.
Specifically, AdvGrasp targets two core aspects: lift capability, which
evaluates the ability to lift objects against gravity, and grasp stability,
which assesses resistance to external disturbances. By deforming the object's
shape to increase gravitational torque and reduce stability margin in the
wrench space, our method systematically degrades these two key grasping
metrics, generating adversarial objects that compromise grasp performance.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the effectiveness of
AdvGrasp, while real-world validations demonstrate its robustness and practical
applicability

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人导航提供了更灵活和可定制的解决方案。

Abstract: Safe navigation within a workspace is a fundamental skill for autonomous
robots to accomplish more complex tasks. Harmonic potentials are artificial
potential fields that are analytical, globally convergent and provably free of
local minima. Thus, it has been widely used for generating safe and reliable
robot navigation control policies. However, most existing methods do not allow
customization of the harmonic potential fields nor the resulting paths,
particularly regarding their topological properties. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that automatically finds homotopy classes of paths that can be
generated by valid harmonic potential fields. The considered complex workspaces
can be as general as forest worlds consisting of numerous overlapping
star-obstacles. The method is based on a hybrid optimization algorithm that
searches over homotopy classes, selects the structure of each tree-of-stars
within the forest, and optimizes over the continuous weight parameters for each
purged tree via the projected gradient descent. The key insight is to transform
the forest world to the unbounded point world via proper diffeomorphic
transformations. It not only facilitates a simpler design of the
multi-directional D-signature between non-homotopic paths, but also retain the
safety and convergence properties. Extensive simulations and hardware
experiments are conducted for non-trivial scenarios, where the navigation
potentials are customized for desired homotopic properties. Project page:

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important
modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material
identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very
recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature
Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its
predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from
multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects
on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld
tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile
sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with
Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will
showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile
inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5
will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how
to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also
plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.
With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress
and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in
this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for
addressing complex control problems, particularly those involving underactuated
robotic systems. However, in some cases, policies may require refinement to
achieve optimal performance and robustness aligned with specific task
objectives. In this paper, we propose an approach for fine-tuning Deep RL
policies using Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to enhance control performance for
underactuated robots. Our method involves initially training an RL agent with
Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) using a surrogate reward function designed to
approximate complex specific scoring metrics. We subsequently refine this
learned policy through a zero-order optimization step employing the Separable
Natural Evolution Strategy (SNES), directly targeting the original score.
Experimental evaluations conducted in the context of the 2nd AI Olympics with
RealAIGym at IROS 2024 demonstrate that our evolutionary fine-tuning
significantly improves agent performance while maintaining high robustness. The
resulting controllers outperform established baselines, achieving competitive
scores for the competition tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces MP-RBFN, a novel formulation leveraging Radial Basis
Function Networks for efficiently learning Motion Primitives derived from
optimal control problems for autonomous driving. While traditional motion
planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often
computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate
high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories.
MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory
generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle
dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous
methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference
times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized
motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the
method into a sampling-based trajectory planner. MP-RBFN is available as
open-source software at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/RBFN-Motion-Primitives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）需要与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）在异构交通环境中有效协作，但现有换道框架忽视了HVs的动态信任水平，导致行为预测不准确。

Method: 研究提出TGLD框架，包括多车联盟博弈建模、实时信任评估方法，以及考虑社会兼容性目标的设计。

Result: 实验验证表明，AVs能根据HVs的信任水平和驾驶风格调整策略，信任机制显著提高了换道效率、安全性及交互透明度。

Conclusion: TGLD框架通过信任感知和博弈论方法，实现了更适应人类驾驶行为的自动驾驶换道策略。

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible
behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in
heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing
frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to
accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study
proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework.
First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully
cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs
informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust
evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during
lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate
cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered
by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the
predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and
context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment
conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.
Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different
HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism
significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and
contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate
the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an
autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.

paradigm in robotics. These models offer powerful capabilities in semantic
understanding, high-level reasoning, and cross-modal generalization, enabling
significant advances in perception, planning, control, and human-robot

open-world execution, sim-to-real transfer, and adaptable robotics. Unlike
existing surveys that emphasize isolated capabilities, this work highlights
integrated, system-level strategies and evaluates their practical feasibility
in real-world environments. Key enabling trends such as procedural scene
generation, policy generalization, and multimodal reasoning are discussed
alongside core bottlenecks, including limited embodiment, lack of multimodal

Conclusion: 该方法为无传感器扭矩控制提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of
humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with
electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented
Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque
control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from
joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation
without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as
direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental
validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking
accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection
compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using
a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by
consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different
friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative
analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque
control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical
solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高人机协作中意图推断的准确性，避免限制人类控制或引发冲突。

Method: GUIDER框架包含导航和操作两个耦合的信念层，分别使用Synergy Map和多模态感知技术（如U2Net、FastSAM）进行意图估计。

Conclusion: GUIDER的双阶段框架有效提升了移动操作任务中的意图推断能力。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Developing robust locomotion controllers for bipedal robots with closed
kinematic chains presents unique challenges, particularly since most
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simplify these parallel mechanisms into
serial models during training. We demonstrate that this simplification
significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential
aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control
characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly
incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot
TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss
functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable
locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based
on simplified kinematic models.

Conclusion: REACT框架有效解决了缆绳缠绕问题，提升了水下检测任务的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles
is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT
(real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater
vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a
fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for
accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary
structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by
enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing
entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we
achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether
constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe
inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and
full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete
coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission
20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to
proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission
disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT
completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical
tether entanglement.

Abstract: Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires
agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize
coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward
formulations that lack semantic adaptability. This study proposes
Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates
the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large
language models with curiosity-driven RL. PIRL leverages semantic feedback from
an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera
adjustments for optimal visual coverage. The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI
Gym and evaluated in various environments. Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like
ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the
agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics. Results
show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with
static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning,
and an LLM-only controller. Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the
best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in
OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and
up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment. The results
highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial
exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural
language priors into RL for robotics.

Abstract: Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often
done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following
is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating
constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the
cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and
typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is
contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value
defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to
overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to
continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as
constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of
half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a
polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and
therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key
contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such
constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are
compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory
planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable
outside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems are highly dependent on sensors like cameras,
LiDAR, and inertial measurement units (IMU) to perceive the environment and
estimate their motion. Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not
protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods
show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment
and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental
factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research
introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual,
inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to
improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse
environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed
model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the
contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with
radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work
explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar
robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for
pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded.
Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness
and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based

modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

Abstract: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach.
However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off
between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural
constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit
consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs
3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action
trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning
the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any
additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical
ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1
further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while
retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because
subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in
few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state
embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference.
We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average
task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its
average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster
than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.
