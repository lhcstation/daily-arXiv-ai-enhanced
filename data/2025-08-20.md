### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR是一个轻量级实时疲劳检测模型，通过融合卷积注意力模块和矩形校准模块，在DSM数据集上取得了87.17%的精确率和88.09%的mAP@50，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性强、硬件依赖、鲁棒性差等问题，视觉方法虽然非侵入但面临小目标检测困难和多尺度特征建模不足的挑战。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积注意力融合模块（CAFM）整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块（RCM）捕获水平和垂直上下文信息改善空间定位。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到精确率87.17%、召回率83.86%、mAP@50为88.09%、mAP@50-95为55.93%，显著超越基线模型。消融实验验证了CAFM和RCM模块的有效性。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，相比现有方法在基准测试上提升5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室干净环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的复杂场景，真实图像包含噪声、来自多种生成模型且经过后期编辑

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含互联网采集和合成数据），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先现有最佳检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准有效模拟真实世界AI生成图像的复杂性，Mirage-R1模型通过反射推理机制在检测性能和推理速度之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DianJin-OCR-R1框架，通过理由与工具交错的视觉语言模型来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，并提升OCR任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题，且在OCR任务上效果不如专业模型，需要一种方法结合两者优势

Method: 设计理由与工具交错的VLM框架，先用自身OCR能力识别内容，然后调用其他专业模型获取参考结果，最后重新看图像并重新思考理由过程以提供最终识别结果

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续超越非理由版本和专业OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过理由与工具交错的方式，可以有效减少LVLM的幻觉问题，同时利用专业模型的优势来提升OCR性能，为文档图像解析提供了一种成本效益更高的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习，在组件分类任务上达到了99%的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种草书形式的语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法往往导致高错误率。需要开发一种更有效的识别方法来处理这种语言的特殊挑战。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，构建了一个两层次的层次神经网络。通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术过滤掉不必要的图像，仅保留连字组合。

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上成功达到了99%的识别精度，显示出极高的性能。

Conclusion: 这种基于CNN的组件分类方法为处理乌尔都语这类草书形式语言的光学字符识别问题提供了一种高效的解决方案，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率问题。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并考虑MES评分的序数性质，显著提高了溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类存在标签噪声和序数性质被忽略的问题，需要一种能够同时处理标签可靠性和序数结构的分类方法

Method: 使用基于BBPS标签训练的轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习顺序，结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE在CNN和Transformer模型上都显著提升性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效改善序数分类性能，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态序列，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据稀缺和隐私保护限制的问题，需要一种能够生成多样化、高质量步态数据的方法。

Method: 使用视频扩散模型在步态轮廓数据上从头训练，生成时间一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件控制。

Result: 将合成样本加入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；通过身份嵌入插值生成的新身份数据具有独特且一致的步态模式。

Conclusion: 该工作为利用扩散模型实现高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致推理延迟和内存消耗急剧增加，阻碍了实际部署

Method: 提出了两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）基于下游驾驶任务重要性学习每个摄像头视图最优剪枝比率的视图自适应剪枝控制器

Result: 在DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token时实现了6.4倍预填充阶段加速和13.4%的原始FLOPs消耗，性能仅下降3%

Conclusion: Prune2Drive提供了一种无需模型重训练或注意力图访问的高效视觉token剪枝解决方案，显著提升了多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 采用多阶段方式：每阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标（SSIM、LPIPS、FID）均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep
learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and
domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse
conditions.
  This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation
metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip
current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能选出正确答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成难负选项，创建无偏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准存在选项偏差，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似度匹配直接推断答案，无法真实评估模型的问答能力。

Method: 通过接地实验发现视觉相关性不平衡问题，开发GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上可信的难负选项，创建EOB-free标注数据。

Result: 在无偏标注数据上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率显著下降，提供了更真实的评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的选项偏差问题，提出的解决方案能更准确地评估VLMs的真实问答能力，相关代码和标注数据将发布。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功解决了面部特征独立控制和多模态输入共享的问题，在可控说话头生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层参数来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独MLP导致的计算和存储效率低下问题

Method: 分析训练好的INR权重分布，共享中间层，保留输入输出层为图像专用，并设计额外的投影层捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中节省60%参数，处理100张图像时平均PSNR保持34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法在多图像编码中具有高效性和可扩展性，且在不同骨干网络上表现鲁棒

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时对权重和激活进行量化，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分发挥量化硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1）分析发现INRs中首尾层权重分布与中间层不同，最后一层激活与前层显著差异；2）使用哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布；3）应用标准量化器进行量化；4）在FPGA上实现硬件高效设计。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高降低98.3%，性能优于先前量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化方案，成功实现了INRs中权重和激活的高效量化，显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的实际部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel

noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人6D姿态估计设计的工业环境数据集，解决了现有数据集局限于小型家庭物品的问题，包含92个真实场景和16个独特物体，覆盖了远距离视角、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡等移动机器人特有的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机器人臂操作的小型家庭物品，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中的需求，如远距离感知、大尺寸物体、严重自遮挡和多样化相机视角等挑战。

Method: 创建了MR6D数据集，包含92个真实工业场景和16个独特物体，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉了移动平台特有的挑战因素。

Result: 初步实验显示，现有的6D姿态估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍。

Conclusion: MR6D为针对移动机器人需求开发和评估姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了工业环境中6D姿态估计数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 通过转移单打训练模型和对比学习框架，将姿态基于投网球识别扩展到羽毛球双打比赛分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球双打比赛在国际赛事中更为普遍，但以前研究主要集中单打，因为数据获取和多人跟踪面临挑战

Method: 使用ViT-Pose提取关键点，通过ST-GCN基础的对比学习框架进行嵌入，采用自定义多目标跟踪算法解决ID切换问题，使用Transformer分类器识别投网球动作

Result: 证明了将姿态基于投网球识别扩展到双打羽毛球的可行性

Conclusion: 为双打特定数据集建立了基础，推进了这种主流但研究不足的快速投网球运动格式的理解

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图像标记化器VGQ，通过集成2D高斯分布来改善对几何结构的建模，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化基于标记化器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征，忽视了几何结构，导致结构信息编码不足。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将2D高斯分布集成到传统视觉码本量化框架中，通过直接建模位置、旋转和缩放等结构相关参数来提升结构建模能力。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试中，VGQ达到rFID 1.00的重建质量，通过增加高斯密度进一步提升到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过明确建模2D高斯分布来提升结构建模能力，为图像标记化提供了更丰富的视觉信息编码，在重建质量方面取得了量着提升。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Motivation: 深度学习中存在训练样本与真实分布的差距，这可能由采样偏差、噪声等因素导致。在基础模型时代，需要找到新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 利用CLIP、DINOv2等视觉基础模型进行特征提取，发现特征分布的几何形状具有跨领域可转移性。构建几何知识导向的分布检查框架，应用于联邦学习和长尾分布识别两个场景。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法能够有效克服由数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在多个测试集上都取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 基于基础模型特征分布几何形状的跨领域可转移性为解决样本分布差距问题提供了有效途径，在联邦学习和长尾识别中都发挥了重要作用。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表惉感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了高保真头部虚拟人重建中的细粒度表惉捕捉和纹理连续性问题

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题，在2D图像表示/恢复和3D重建任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间局部化；2) WEGE编码机制，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数，显式指导频率信息到网络

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复、3D重建任务中持续优于现有INRs方法

Conclusion: FLAIR通过创新的频率感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Method: 使用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置

Result: 在综合VR数据集上达到3.83度的中位角度误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能

Conclusion: 软件-only的注视预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转方向方面的视觉推理能力，检验它们是否能像人类一样准确感知空间关系和旋转线索。

Method: 构建包含350张图像的RotBench基准测试集，测试多种先进MLLMs（包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等）在0°、90°、180°、270°四个旋转角度上的识别能力，并尝试使用辅助信息、思维链提示、多角度同时显示等策略来提升性能。

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别正立（0°）图像，部分能识别倒立（180°）图像，但所有模型都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示只能带来有限且不一致的改进，微调也无法改善90°/270°的区分能力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在图像旋转识别任务上存在显著局限性，特别是在区分90°和270°旋转方面表现不佳，表明其空间推理能力与人类视觉感知仍有较大差距。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 解决生成式人脸视频编码(GFVC)模型参数过大、计算成本过高的问题，以便在资源受限环境(如移动边缘设备)中实际部署

Method: 双模式优化策略：结构重设(用更薄的卷积层替换3x3卷积)和操作精化(两阶段适应性额次剪削策略，包括训练期软剪削和训练后硬剪削)

Result: 实验结果显示相比基准线，可实现90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，仍能超越VVC标准的感知质量指标

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持重构质量的前提下大幅降低复杂度，为生成式人脸视频编码在资源受限环境中的实际部署提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 这种受生物启发的方法有望突破神经科学计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了对未见类别的异常检测，避免了传统方法对已知异常样本的依赖，展现了优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

*Yuchen Yang,Linfeng Dong,Wei Wang,Zhihang Zhong,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify是一个神经框架，用单次回归模型替代SMPLify中的迭代优化过程，实现近200倍的速度提升，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中作为稳健基准，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化取得显著运行时改进的启发。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，使用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间。支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Result: 方法实现近200倍的速度提升，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上以模型无关方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基准，显著提高了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

Motivation: 直观觉得当前RVOS方法过度关注特征提取和时间建模，而对分割头的设计相对忽视，存在显著的改进空间。

Method: 提出时间条件引用视频对象分割模型：1)整合现有分割方法提升边界分割能力 2)利用文本到视频滴汉模型进行特征提取 3)删除传统噪声预测模块以避免随机性 4)设计时间上下文掩码精细化模块(TCMR)充分利用VAE特征

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计，创新地结合现有分割技术和滴汉模型特征，可以在不增加复杂度的情况下显著提升引用视频对象分割的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，而相关数据集缺乏恶劣条件数据，收集和标注成本高。

Method: 提出新的领域适配管线，包括模拟、GAN和混合死灭-GAN方法，从标注清晰图像合成实际恶劣图像。利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，开发新训练方法结合模拟和实际图像。

Conclusion: 该混合领域适配方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下的感知稳健性，为解决数据缺乏问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍有待提升。现有token削减方法未充分考虑SSM独特的序列建模特性，需要专门针对SSM设计的高效token合并策略。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量指标；2) 引入战略性token排列以保持序列信息流；3) 专门针对SSM架构特性进行优化设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间达到优异平衡，即使在激进token削减下仍保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方案，通过专门设计的token合并策略成功解决了序列信息保持和计算效率优化的双重挑战，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效分离和精炼语义与几何优先信息，通过专门化处理途径和高效融合方法，实现了语义场景完成性能的显著提升

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench来平衡关键人口统计和语言维度。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体始位估计提供了新的研究视角，具有强大的应用潜力

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然通过CFG在多个领域取得了优异性能，但生成样本质量对引导权重选择高度敏感。作者发现这是由于训练和推理阶段存在显著差距，导致条件生成性能受损。

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，这是一种基于优化的方法，通过在推理阶段的每一步进行迭代误差最小化来减少累积误差，从而缓解训练-推理差距问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过创新的混合架构，成功结合了图生成方法的高效率和图增长方法的动态性，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升了路网拓扑结构的准确性和空间一致性，为遥感图像路网提取领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证的多选题和手动策划的视频推理测试，评估显示现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面仍面临重大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，对人工通用智能的追求需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉理解的关键技能。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两个层级包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并主动提取超出问题提示的上下文。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取关键主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导的检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也有限。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和以人类为中心的应用发展，揭示了当前模型在人类相关视觉理解方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，通过数据、网络和特征三个层面的多样性增强，实现半监督医学图像分割的突破性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高昂，半监督分割技术能利用未标注数据生成伪标签。Mamba等状态空间模型在处理长程依赖方面表现出色，值得探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的应用潜力

Method: DCMamba框架：1)数据层面-基于Mamba扫描特性的补丁级弱-强混合增强；2)网络层面-多样化扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3)特征层面-不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Conclusion: DCMamba通过多角度多样性增强策略，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的应用价值

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段进行精细化的视觉-语言模型攻击，解决了现有方法在精细度和效果上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标攻击方法通过扰动图像来最大化全局相似性，将丰富的视觉语义压缩成单一全局向量，限制了攻击的精细度。同时忽视了投影器模块这个关键的语义桥梁，导致攻击效果不佳。

Method: 提出IPGA攻击方法，首次利用投影器模块（Q-Former）的中间阶段，将全局图像嵌入转换为精细化视觉特征。还提出殊殊查询对齐（RQA）技术来保持无关的视觉内容。

Result: 实验结果显示，IPGA在标准全局图像描述任务和精细化视觉问答任务中都明显超过现有方法，并成功过渡到多个商业VLM模型。

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器模块的中间表征，实现了更精确和可控的对抗性攻击，为视觉-语言模型的安全漏洞识别提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码多张图像来防止视觉信息泄露，显著提升多图像任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄露问题

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像，引导模型专注于单张干净图像；重复此过程获取部分掩码上下文下的logits，聚合后使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多相机3D形状非刚性配准方法，使用广义相机模型处理任意视角相机配置，通过凸规划和迭代优化实现高精度重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图像SfT方法受限，多相机联合信息能够扩展3D形状配准的应用范围，如医学成像和手持相机场景，提高重建精度

Method: 使用广义相机模型表示多相机系统，提出三种方法：已知3D点的方向向量对应、未知3D点但已知方向对应、以及包含轮廓信息的对应方法，分别采用凸规划和迭代优化求解

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了方法的准确性，展示了多视角约束带来的重建精度提升

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的解决方案集，通过多视角互约束显著提高了变形形状估计的精度，为多相机3D配准开辟了新方向

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略和视觉引导的本构评估机制，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，解决了现有方法在泛化性和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法推断物体内在动力学面临两大挑战：基于手动定义本构先验的方法难以泛化到复杂场景；基于神经网络的方法可解释性差且泛化能力有限。需要一种能够从视觉观察中推断可解释内在动力学的方法。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，通过解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层利用视觉模拟评估生成本构定律与底层内在动力学的一致性，指导上层演化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能够有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的可解释性和泛化性问题，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，为物理合理的交互模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型性能并提供临床依据的解释。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床语言，通过跨模态注意力机制融合多模态特征。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型，多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本对分割准确性和解释质量至关重要，能同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级利用反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时将攻击延迟减少了超过56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的对抗攻击方法在疾风神经网络(SNNs)上存在显著的攻击延迟问题，这主要是因为它们直接扩展自ANN范式，没有充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理耗时过长，不适合实时应用。

Method: 提出时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级利用反向传播(TLBP)，基于发现生成干扰的全局时间信息并非关键，支持按时间步评估并提前停止；2)对抗膜电位重用(A-MPR)，利用初始时间步主要用于累积膜电位的特点，将这些预计算的值重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，TCA在白盒和黑盒攻击情况下分别将必要的攻击延迟减少了最56.6%和57.1%，同时保持了相当的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过充分利用SNN的特有性质，有效解决了现有攻击方法的高延迟问题，为疾风神经网络的实时对抗攻击提供了可行的解决方案，在保持攻击效果的同时显著提升了攻击效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，不需要标签数据

Result: 在8个北美城市应用，方法高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够为缺乏详细数据的城市提供生物多样性地图制作，支持低成本连续监测和城市生态系统的适应性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示（LCRs）来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础的表征，提高对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主要训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往在分布内表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力差，容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，并通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中，LCRReg显著提高了对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中增强了合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提高模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和事后概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 单元格LSTM模型预测南亚霜霾氯化氯氯指数，达到五天预报精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区霜霾事件严重影响生态和经济，但缺乏有效的实时预报系统

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P数据和卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，以紫外线氯化氯氯指数作为预测因子

Result: 模型在五天预报间隔下平均方差错误为0.0018，损失值0.3995，结构相似性指数0.74

Conclusion: 模型预测效果良好，但需整合更多数据和优化等方面进一步改进

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了医学超声图像分割中的长程依赖和局部上下文问题，为该领域提供了一种新的解决方案

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Motivation: 当前人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未被充分探索，需要开发基于ViT的FIQA方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双分支结构分别学习人脸表示和质量预测。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试和各种人脸识别模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了Transformer架构在建模人脸图像效用方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA展示了基于Transformer的架构在人脸图像质量评估中的优势，为未来FIQA研究提供了可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Conclusion: 通过为不同难度视频选择适当的注释级别，结合伪标签生成技术，可以在保持视频动作检测性能的同时大幅减少注释工作量和成本。

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become
increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has
motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still

reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact
while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.
Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment方法简单有效，为数据中毒后门攻击提供了新的解决方案，在理论和实践上都取得了显著进展

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame

TL;DR: DetailGen3D是一个专门用于增强生成3D形状几何细节的生成方法，通过潜在空间中的数据依赖流实现从粗糙到精细的转换，避免了大规模3D生成模型的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代3D生成方法能够从稀疏或单视图快速创建形状，但由于计算限制，其输出往往缺乏几何细节。需要一种专门的方法来增强这些生成的3D形状的细节质量。

Method: 采用数据依赖流在潜在空间中直接建模从粗糙到精细的转换，引入token匹配策略确保细化过程中的准确空间对应，使局部细节合成的同时保持全局结构。通过精心设计训练数据以匹配合成粗糙形状的特征。

Result: 方法能够有效增强各种3D生成和重建方法产生的形状，从单视图到稀疏多视图输入。实现了高保真度的几何细节合成，同时保持训练效率。

Conclusion: DetailGen3D通过创新的潜在空间流建模和token匹配策略，成功解决了生成3D形状缺乏细节的问题，为3D生成领域提供了高效的细节增强解决方案。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的素蕴视频检索数据集Dense-WebVid-CoVR和交叉注意力融合模型，解决组合查询的细粒度检索挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准检索框架在处理细粒度组合查询和时间理解变化方面遇到困难，需要更好的数据集和模型来支持详细的视频描述和密集修改文本

Method: 构建包含160万样本的Dense-WebVid-CoVR数据集，开发使用基础文本编码器的交叉注意力融合模型，实现密集查询修改与目标视频的精确对齐

Result: 模型在所有指标上超越现有方法，在视觉+文本设置下达到71.3% Recall@1，比最佳方法提升3.4%

Conclusion: 该研究通过新的数据集和融合模型有效解决了素蕴视频检索的挑战，为细粒度组合查询提供了强大的基础设施

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Conclusion: LongSplat为长视频无位姿3D高斯泼溅提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过联合优化策略和高效的内存管理机制，成功解决了现有方法的关键局限性。

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种扩展的演员级判别流水线，用于检测和减少大规模文本语料库中的性别偏见，并在德国报纸语料库中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型输出常反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡，需要方法来检测和减少这种偏见。

Method: 基于话语感知公平性分析，提出新的演员级指标，包括情感、句法主动性和引用风格的不对称性，支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于平衡。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸语料库(1980-2024)中实现了多个语言维度上的显著性别平衡改善，表面层不对称性可通过筛选和重新平衡减少，但情感和框架中的更细微偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够有效检测和减少文本语料中的性别偏见，工具和报告已发布以支持进一步的话语公平性审计和公平语料建设研究。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网络浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理在多模态检索和推理方面的能力，现有最先进模型仅达到29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网络浏览基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注文本信息，忽略了多模态内容的普遍存在，需要填补这一空白来评估AI代理的多模态能力。

Method: 创建了包含224个挑战性问题的MM-BrowseComp基准测试，这些问题在提示中经常包含图像，网页上的关键信息也可能嵌入在图像或视频中，同时为每个问题提供验证清单以进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的综合评估显示，即使是像OpenAI o3这样的顶级模型，在使用工具的情况下也仅达到29.02%的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型的多模态能力不足，缺乏本地的多模态推理能力，MM-BrowseComp基准测试突显了这一差距，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但在设备上实现流式实时翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要找到翻译质量与延迟之间的有效平衡方案。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索来管理上下文，采用效率析成技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时性能。

Result: 在设备上双语对话语音翻译中应用该方法，在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线系统，缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该技术为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译开启了新路径，有力推动语音翻译技术的实时性能提升。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的推理能力对习语检测性能的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变，大模型能较好理解习语含义而小模型表现较差，提供定义提示可以改善小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型的发展，大型语言模型在需要逻辑步骤的任务上表现提升。习语检测作为需要理解后才能消歧的语言任务，可能受益于推理能力的提升，因此研究推理能力对习语检测的影响。

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析思维链推理的效果，并尝试为小模型提供定义提示。

Result: 推理效果比预期小且多变：小模型通过思维链推理从数学调优中间模型获得性能提升但不及基础模型，大模型（14B、32B、70B）显示适度改进。大模型能准确生成表达定义，小模型常失败。提供定义提示可在某些情况下改善小模型性能。

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型展现出良好的习语理解能力，而小模型需要额外辅助（如定义提示）来提升性能，推理能力对习语检测的改善效果有限且因模型规模而异。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中存在语法和语义准确性不足的问题，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号等任务的性能

Method: 使用两种策略：(1)通过最优运输进行标记级利润对齐维度和序列长度，(2)最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表示之间的表示损失，混合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在词错误率(WER)、命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号成功率方面取得显著改善

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，该方法强调了将语言上下文集成到转录中的价值，为长形式语音提供了健壮、上下文感知的ASR基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。该模型通过轨迹式训练、双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个定量领域表现出色，准确率提升30%，同时减少18-49%的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂问题求解时经常出现循环推理、token膨胀等问题，需要开发能够产生完整分析轨迹、支持代码执行和自我修正的虚拟数据分析师模型。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架结合轻量级结构信号和分层奖励模型；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现，包含KV缓存重用和顺序生成；4) 余弦课程从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench准确率提升30%，每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双推理接口设计，成功解决了RL对齐LLM常见的格式崩溃和冗长问题，展现出"顿悟时刻"模式，能够高效收敛到正确解决方案

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在跨文化交流中仍存在训练语料分布偏差问题，缺乏有效的文化建模和对齐方法，需要探索基于人类认知的文化对齐解决方案。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词汇联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT使英语P@5提升16-20%，中文提升43-165%，具体性中位数提升+0.20，达到人类水平的情感效价和唤醒度。在世界价值观调查中，微调模型向目标文化偏移，高张力问题上的文化偏见显著降低。

Conclusion: 几百万个基于文化的联想足以实现价值对齐而无需昂贵重训练，7-8B模型性能可媲美70B基线，凸显了基于人类认知的文化对齐研究的重要性和前景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在交互式临床咨询中存在误诊风险

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1)SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高奖励轨迹；2)SIG增强的策略优化结合新颖的SIG引导奖励分布机制

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现鲁棒

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM转变为主动提问范式，通过量化临床价值的SIG奖励机制显著提升了交互式医疗诊断的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言(奈吉迪和汉志方言)支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的捕捉能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466条合成指令-响应对)，采用LoRA微调技术训练ALLAM-7B模型；测试两种方案：方言标签训练(在指令前添加明确方言标签)和无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型表现最佳，将沙特方言生成率从47.97%提升到84.21%，MSA漏泄率从32.63%降至6.21%；文本保真度持续改善(chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059)，超越了多个基线模型

Conclusion: LoRA微调技术能够有效提升阿拉伯模型对特定方言的支持能力，方言标签方法在方言控制和文本质量方面都显示出优势，为少数语言变体的模型训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在低资源语言泰卢固语中的能力，了解模型局限性，为开发更具语言能力的模型提供信息，并为未来泰卢固语NLP研究奠定基础。

Method: 创建包含729个多选题和开放性问题的泰卢固语评估数据集MATA，评估11个大语言模型，分析模型对答案位置和干扰项模式等表面启发式的依赖，比较模型评估与人工评估的可靠性。

Result: 研究展示了LLMs在多选题中依赖表面启发式策略，揭示了模型在低资源语言评估中的局限性，并比较了模型评估与人工评估的差异。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 压缩模型虽然能达到与原大模型相近的准确率，但在可解释性对齐和校准相似性方面存在显著差异，不能完全信任其预测结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能对等并不保证信任对等，需要评估压缩模型是否真正可信

Method: 提出二维信任对等评估框架：1)可解释性对齐(LIME和SHAP测试) 2)校准相似性(ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图)

Result: 实验发现压缩模型与原模型在可解释性对齐度低，校准相似性存在显著不匹配，即使准确率几乎相同

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能作为大模型的直接替代品，部署时需要超越性能对等的谨慎评估

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗领域的LLM文本生成中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小影响质量但增加推理时间，医疗专用模型在部分任务中表现更好但对解码策略更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对文本生成的准确性要求极高，但解码策略对医疗LLM输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估不同解码策略在医疗任务中的表现。

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同尺寸模型，比较多种评估指标。

Result: beam search表现最佳，随机采样策略最差；大模型质量更高但推理时间更长；医疗LLM在部分任务中优于通用模型但对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标间相关性因任务而异。

Conclusion: 解码策略选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择本身，需要根据具体任务谨慎选择解码方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

TL;DR: 语音LLM如Bark在说话者选择上显示出某些性别偏向，但没有系统性偏见，但具有性别意识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音LLM是否像文本LLM一样存在性别偏见，通过说话者分配来分析模型偏见

Method: 构建两个数据集：职业数据集（包含性别刻板印职业）和性别色彩词汇数据集，分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话者分配

Result: Bark模型没有显示系统性偏见，但表现出了性别意识和某些性别倾向

Conclusion: 语音LLM在说话者选择方面显示出与文本LLM不同的偏见特征，说话者分配可作为有效的偏见分析工具

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久的概念遗忘，通过自动识别并抑制多层的显著特征，在保持模型通用能力的同时有效移除有害知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不良知识同时保持模型效用的需求变得至关重要。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的显著特征，并抑制这些特征的激活，实现参数高效的持久概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标与良性概念的语义连贯分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级持久概念遗忘方法，通过稀疏自编码器特征干预实现了精确的目标特征抑制，为模型安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试中的表现，发现现有模型表现远低于人类平均水平，跨语言提示反而降低性能，人机协作可部分提升表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型(VLMs)主要在英语多模态任务上表现优异，但在低资源语言(如越南语)的真实多模态教育内容上的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要评估这些主要基于英语数据训练的模型是否能处理现实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 提出ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶测试和智商测试等7个学术领域，对最先进的VLMs进行全面评估，并测试跨语言提示和人机协作策略。

Result: 最先进的VLMs平均准确率仅为57.74%，开源模型为27.70%，大多数模型低于人类平均水平(66.54%)。只有o3思考模型(74.07%)超过人类平均但仍远低于人类最佳表现(99.60%)。跨语言提示反而使SOTA模型准确率下降1个百分点，人机协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不佳，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要开发更好的跨语言多模态模型来支持低资源语言的教育应用，人机协作是提升性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型处理泛型概括（如'鸟会飞'）的可废止推理能力，这对非单调逻辑、默认推理和认知科学具有重要意义。

Method: 使用20种可废止推理模式测试28个LLM，比较零样本、少样本和思维链提示的效果，分析模型区分可废止推理和演绎推理的能力。

Result: 前沿模型表现较好但差异显著，少样本提示略有改善，思维链提示导致平均准确率下降11.14%，多数模型难以区分可废止推理或将泛型误解为普遍陈述。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也存在明显局限，需要改进对泛型陈述的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文挖知了对单词嵌入知识解释方法的偏见，证明仅靠预测准确性无法可靠表明嵌入真正含有语义知识，因为这些方法甚至能预测随机信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何确定深度学习模型中隐式编码的知识，提高AI系统的可解释性，并批判传统上以预测准确性作为嵌入知识含量标准的偏见。

Method: 通过将单词嵌入映射到人类可解释的语义特征集合（特征规范），并证明这些方法甚至能成功预测随机信息，显示结果主要由算法上限决定而非嵌入的真实语义表征。

Result: 预测准确性单独不能可靠表明嵌入含有对应知识，这种映射主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，而非语义属性的真正出现。

Conclusion: 仅依靠预测性能进行数据集比较不可靠，需要发展更健壮的方法来评估嵌入中的知识含量，以提高AI系统解释性的可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Result: 实验表明EEG-MedRAG在答案准确性和检索性能上显著优于TimeRAG和HyperGraphRAG，显示出在真实世界临床决策支持中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: EEG-MedRAG框架为解决EEG数据检索和解释的挑战提供了有效解决方案，并建立了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床问答基准，为系统评估疾病无关泛化和角色感知上下文理解提供了基础。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域存在奏尊性问题，即无论正确与否都会结合用户信念，这在科学问答等高风险场景中带来严重风险。

Method: 提出统一评估框架，包括对抗性提示设置和目标指标，并设计Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话和思维链理由上进行轻量细调来减少奏尊性。

Result: 对开源和专有模型的系统评估显示了普遍的奏尊倾向，主要由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小。Pressure-Tune在具有挑战性的科学问答测试中显著提升了奏尊抵抗力，而不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: 奏尊性是大语言模型在事实性领域的重要问题，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在不損害模型其他性能的前提下提升模型的真实性和原则性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在相同领域训练测试时表现良好，但在面对不同来源数据的领域偏移时泛化能力差

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本和人类撰写文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异。设计低频域滤波模块过滤对领域偏移敏感的文档级特征，采用动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变的特征

Result: 在三个领域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了有效的领域泛化解决方案，MGT-Prism方法在跨域检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Motivation: 评估LLM生成文本是否类似儿童语言，以了解LLM在教育和心理语言学研究中的适用性。

Method: 使用零械提示和少量提示生成德语LLM文本语料库，与儿童图片故事描述语料库进行对比分析，包括词频、词汇丰富性、句长、词性标签和语义相似性等心理语言学指标。

Result: LLM生成文本比儿童文本更长但词汇丰富性更低，更多使用高频词，名词使用不足，语义空间分析显示相似性很低。少量提示仅能稍微提高相似性。

Conclusion: LLM无法准确模仿儿童语言的词汇和语义特征，对于LLM在儿童教育工具中的使用适当性提出疑问。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过贝叶斯方法大规模评估主流大语言模型的道德理解能力，发现AI模型的道德检测效果较人类注释者更优异，特别是在减少假阻性错误方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究多使用确定性真实值（多数决或包含规则），无法抓取注释者分歧所带来的不确定性。本研究旨在通过模型化注释者不同意来更全面评估语言模型的道德理解能力。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，处理超100万个文本的250万+注释，模型化注释者分歧以抓取随机不确定性（人类内在分歧）和认知不确定性（模型领域敏感性）。评估Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型。

Result: AI模型通常能够排在前25%的人类注释者之列，达到较人类平均水平更高的平衡准确率。特别是，AI产生的假阻性错误远少于人类，显示出更敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究显示了大语言模型在道德理解方面的优异表现，特别是在减少假阻性错误方面。这为AI模型在道德判断任务中的应用提供了重要依据，同时也为更精确评估AI模型的道德能力开发了新的贝叶斯方法。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过插入计数器标记的提示工程，使大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，无需微调或迭代金子采样


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确控制长度，要么超过要求要么较短，因为模型无法可靠进行内部词汇计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次性策略，在提示中添加倒计数标记和明确的计数规则，让模型在写作过程中同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累素提示下的30%以下提升到95%以上，超越了普遍使用的草稿-重写基线方法，同时保持了评价质量

Conclusion: 程序提示工程单独就能实现准确的长度控制，为训练或解码基础方法提供了轻量级的替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Motivation: 建筑行业中的技术规范文档通常是非结构化的法语文本，手动提取需求耗时且容易出错，需要自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 采用基于transformer的CamemBERT模型和法语语言模型Fr_core_news_lg，结合命名实体识别(NER)和关系抽取(RE)技术，使用手工标注的数据集进行模型训练和比较。

Result: NER任务中CamemBERT和Fr_core_news_lg表现最佳，F1分数超过90%；RE任务中随机森林模型效果最好，F1分数超过80%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从法语建筑技术规范文档中自动提取需求，为构建知识图谱和自动化验证系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作机器人需要专家编程或手动导航，限制了程序的可变性和表达能力，需要更灵活的编程方式

Method: 定义RATS（重复组装任务）作为2D构建任务，创建包含人工编写、模板基础和模型生成指令的数据集，系统评估先进LLM在上下文学习中生成代码的能力

Result: LLM能够生成准确的一阶代码（指令序列），但在生成高阶代码（函数、循环等抽象）方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 大语言模型在协作机器人对话式编程中具有潜力，特别是在基础指令生成方面，但在复杂抽象能力上仍需改进

Abstract: While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household
environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on
shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there.
``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly
lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make
changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs.
To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs),
and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for
conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the
``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation
for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer'
instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be
built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We
create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions
(human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With
this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for
synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a
simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate
`first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing
`higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准测试，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为多模态大语言模型的科学推理能力评估提供了重要工具

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Conclusion: 提出的LongMab-PO框架通过MAB策略有效解决了长文本建模中的数据质量和多样性问题，为LLMs的长文本能力优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在提高Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，减少生成多样性并限制Pass@k性能

Method: 在线自我对弈与变分问题合成策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题同时保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准上一致有效

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，显著提升LLM推理能力的上限表现

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在向智能体系统演进时，通过特定任务微调提升能力，但安全考量常被忽视。研究发现对齐的LLM在微调后可能无意中失准，更易执行有害任务且拒绝倾向降低。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法：采用迭代方法交替生成候选前缀和选择最优前缀，这些前缀能同时优化任务性能和拒绝行为。前缀以自然语言形式预置到智能体响应前。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的安全防护方法，通过自然语言前缀注入成功解决了LLM智能体微调中的安全隐患，为构建更安全的AI系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

*Kshitij Kavimandan,Pooja Mangal,Devanshi Mehta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 构建了一个基于树莓派4的移动监控机器人，支持实时视频流和语音交互，可通过手机或浏览器直控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个使用商业硬件和开源软件的易复现监控机器人系统，支持远程监控和语音控制

Method: 采用双Raspberry Pi 4系统架构，使用YOLOv3进行对象检测，FFmpeg视频传输，Python语音处理库实现语音识别和翻译，Kinect RGB-D传感器提供视觉输入

Result: 室内测试中能够在CPU上以交互帧率检测常见物体，可靠识别命令并自动转换为动作，无需手动控制

Conclusion: 设计依赖商业硬件和开源软件，易于复现，并提出了传感器融合、GPU加速、人脸和文本识别等扩展可能性

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

*Sidharth Talia,Oren Salzman,Siddhartha Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*)算法，通过动态组织顶点扩展而非刚性剪枝，在运动规划中比传统Hybrid A*减少6倍扩展次数，实现实时高性能规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型树搜索的高效组织问题，特别是在越野自主驾驶等实时规划至关重要的应用中。传统Hybrid A*的网格分辨率选择困难：太粗可能导致失败，太细则导致扩展过多和规划缓慢

Method: 提出增量广义混合A* (IGHA*)框架，这是一个随时树搜索框架，动态组织顶点扩展而不使用刚性剪枝。算法可证明匹配或优于传统HA*

Result: 在汽车类机器人的道路运动学和越野动力学规划查询中，IGHA*变体相比优化版HA*减少了6倍的扩展到最佳解的扩展次数。在高保真模拟器的越野实验中，IGHA*优于HA*M

Conclusion: IGHA*在仿真和小型越野车辆上都展示了实时性能，能够在复杂动力学下实现快速、鲁棒的规划，为自动驾驶等应用提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

### [122] [Accelerating Signal-Temporal-Logic-Based Task and Motion Planning of Bipedal Navigation using Benders Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13407)
*Jiming Ren,Xuan Lin,Roman Mineyev,Karen M. Feigh,Samuel Coogan,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于Benders分解的方法来解决双足机器人运动规划中混合整数规划的计算复杂度问题，通过主问题和子问题迭代求解，相比传统方法显著提高了规划速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双足机器人运动规划中的任务和运动规划问题在信号时序逻辑约束下是NP难问题，混合整数规划方法在处理非凸约束（如运动学可达性和脚步旋转）时计算复杂度极高，需要更高效的求解方法。

Method: 采用Benders分解方法，将整体优化问题分解为主问题和子问题：主问题生成满足任务规范的计划原型，子问题进行运动学和动力学可行性检查，通过迭代切割平面技术实现高效求解。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在处理非线性约束的优化程序时，相比其他算法能够实现更快的规划速度。

Conclusion: Benders分解方法有效解决了双足机器人运动规划中混合整数规划的计算复杂度问题，为处理复杂非凸约束提供了一种高效的求解框架。

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged
robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However,
standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in
real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We
present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable
pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body
robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a
representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets
in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree
G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a
quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

*Catherine Glossop,William Chen,Arjun Bhorkar,Dhruv Shah,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过视觉语言模型生成假想反事实标签，提升机器人数据集语言基础的细粒度和多样性，从而显著提高视觉-语言-动作模型的指令追随能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型虽然提供了强大的开政词语语言指令到机器动作的映射架构，但在追随细粒度命令方面仍然遇到困难，主要原因是现有机器人数据集缺乏语义多样性和语言基础

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，利用视觉语言模型为现有机器人数据集创建假想反事实标签，通过生成假想反事实的语言和动作来增加语言基础的多样性和细粒度

Result: 在3种不同的室内外环境中进行视觉语言导航实验，评估了模型追随从简单对象中心命令到复杂参考任务的语言指令能力，导航任务成功率提高27%

Conclusion: 假想反事实重标签方法在不需要额外数据收集的情况下，显著提高了VLA策略的指令追随能力，使其与最先进方法竞争，为通用机器人的语言理解和指令执行提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

*Xu Yang,Jun Ni,Hengyang Feng,Feiyu Wang,Tiezhen Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于新的转向半径角和侧滑角表示法，为全轮全向独立转向车达制定了一种筛波管基线性时变MPC控制策略，实现了高精度位置和方位角同时跟踪控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全轮全向独立转向车达(AWOISV)能够进行偏航、对角线等特殊机动，但现有控制方法在模式切换和强声性方面遇到挑战。需要一种能够在所有运动模式下实现精确位置和方位角控制的统一控制框架。

Method: 提出轮轮转向中心相对时刻转向中心位置的转向半径角和侧滑角(θ_R-β_R)表示法，建立以前进速度v、侧滑角β、航向角速度r为状态的幻位动态模型，并设计筛波管基线性时变MPC(FT-LTVMPC)控制器。

Result: 通过协同模拟和硬件在环(HIL)实验验证，FT-LTVMPC能够在强声性下实现高精度的位置和任意方位角同时跟踪，并保证优秀的实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为AWOISV提供了一种统一的控制框架，能够在所有运动模式下实现精确的位置和方位控制，具有强声性和良好的实时性能，为这类特殊车达的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

Conclusion: 本调研为SMG导航领域建立了统一的分类学和评估标准，有助于解决现有研究的不一致性问题，推动该领域的基准对比、实践应用和新研究者入门，促进社交小游戏导航技术的发展。

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER是一种利用历史轨迹作为先验约束的闭环验证方法，专门针对重复环境中外观特征失效的问题，通过轨迹优化和评分机制来拒绝错误闭环检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重复性环境中，基于外观特征的闭环检测容易产生误判，现有方法忽视了机器人的时空运动轨迹这一重要先验知识，需要一种能够利用轨迹信息进行验证的方法。

Method: 提出ROVER方法：对于每个闭环候选，首先通过位姿图优化估计机器人轨迹，然后通过评分方案评估该轨迹与无闭环时的轨迹先验的符合程度，决定是否接受该闭环候选。

Result: 基准测试和真实环境实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 利用历史轨迹作为先验约束能够有效拒绝重复环境中的错误闭环检测，提高SLAM系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 统一的层次模型预测控制方法，通过高级和低级MPC的分层结构，实现多种机械手槍形态的适配性控制，无需深度参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模块化机械手在不同形态下的控制适配性问题，避免每次更换配置都需要重新调整控制器参数。

Method: 采用两层MPC结构：高级MPC预测未来状态和提供轨迹信息，低级MPC基于这些信息精炼控制动作并更新预测模型。低级MPC还包含二次线性化，抓取运动学模型的二阶泰勒展开信息。

Result: 在多种机械手形态下进行了广泛评估，并在实际场景中演示了摘放任务的执行。方法能够集成运动学约束，确保平滑的关节空间轨迹，甚至在奇异配置附近也能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 该层次MPC方法不仅保持了线性控制模型的简洁性，还提高了运动学表征的精度，从而提升了整体控制精度和可靠性，为模块化机械手提供了一种统一的控制解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: T-WB-DRC框架显著提高了腿式机器人的负载运输能力、外部干扰拒断和故障容耐性，为复杂环境下的稳定控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了一次性泛化，还能生成用于训练视觉运动策略的rollouts，无需费力的遥操作数据收集

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间的普及，需要研究如何通过通信策略提高透明度和减少危险情况，而现有研究对分心行人在机器人身边的行为关注不够

Method: 在现场设置中视频记录了N=498名未意识到研究的行人穿行两个工作中的自主清扫机器人时的行为，对比分析了分心（8%）和未分心行人的运动行为差异

Result: 分心和未分心行人在机器人身边的运动行为没有显著差异；更大的清扫机器人和偏移矩形运动模式显著增加了行人的侧向调整次数；偏移矩形模式导致更多的近距离侧向调整

Conclusion: 研究为公共空间中行人在自主清扫机器人身边的运动行为提供了初步见解，对HRI研究领域做出了贡献，显示机器人设计特性（大小和运动模式）比行人是否分心更能影响行人的运动行为

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

Conclusion: DIPPeR机器人提供了一种高效、自主的爆破孔检测方案，为开采矿山的物料处理节省了重要成本，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

Result: 经过轨迹跟随和点稳定数值实验验证，方法展现出较传统非线性MPC更优秀的跟随精度和显著更低的计算时间

Conclusion: Koopman基于学习方法在处理复杂四旋翼动力学同时满足嵌入式飞行控制实时要求方面具有强大潜力，未来工作将扩展到更灵活的飞行场景和提升对外部干扰的鲁棒性

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了SGDT框架，将神经符号规划器与因果Transformer结合，用于多机器人协作操作任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在复杂动态和长期依赖的多机器人操作任务中存在数据密集和MDP假设限制的问题，而决策变换器在多机器人操作中的应用尚未充分探索

Method: 采用分层架构：神经符号规划器生成符号子目标的高层任务规划，目标条件决策变换器进行低层序列决策

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景下评估了SGDT性能，这是首个探索基于DT技术的多机器人操作工作

Conclusion: SGDT框架实现了结构化、可解释和可泛化的多机器人协作决策

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

TL;DR: 通过大语言模型生成语义驱动行为描述，作为特权信息集成到SVM+模型中，实现了更准确且可解释的驱动风格识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驱动风格识别系统依赖低级传感器特征，忽视了人类专家的语义推理能力，导致算法分类与专家判断之间的差异

Method: 1）开发DriBehavGPT模块生成自然语言驱动行为描述 2）通过文本嵌入和维度降缩转换为机器学习可处理表征 3）作为特权信息集成到SVM+模型进行训练

Result: 在多种实际驱动场景中，SPI增强框架超越传统方法，F1分数提升8.6%（跟车）和7.9%（变道），推理仅需传感器数据，保持计算效率

Conclusion: 语义行为表征在提高识别准确性方面发挥了关键作用，同时推进了可解释性、以人为本的驱动系统发展

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this

foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than
180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,
high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation
of autonomous embodied systems.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

Motivation: HRI研究中对"社交情境"术语的使用缺乏一致性，导致沟通困难和研究成果难以整合，需要建立一个统一的概念框架。

Method: 通过文献综述收集现有定义，提出概念模型来描述人机交互的社交情境，并将该模型应用于现有研究工作。

Conclusion: 提出了统一社交情境描述的概念模型，为HRI研究提供了重要框架，并指出了理解和建模人机交互社交情境的开放研究问题。

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI中的"看到-做到"鸿沟问题，该问题源于数据稀缺和具身异构性，需要一个统一的中间表示来连接高级视觉语言理解和低级动作原语。

Method: 提出"指向"作为统一的具身无关中间表示，构建Embodied-Points-200K大规模数据集，使用两阶段强化微调(RFT)课程训练3B参数的视觉语言模型Embodied-R1。

Result: 在11个具身空间和指向基准测试中达到最先进性能，在SIMPLEREnv中零样本成功率56.2%，在8个真实世界XArm任务中成功率87.5%，比强基线提升62%，对视觉干扰具有高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 以指向为中心的表示结合RFT训练范式，为弥合机器人感知-动作鸿沟提供了有效且可泛化的途径。

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

Conclusion: GEM系统证明了仅用少量演示就能实现动态物体操作的强泛化能力，为制造业效率提升提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.
