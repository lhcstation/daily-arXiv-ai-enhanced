### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ResPA的新攻击方法，通过利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性有限。

Method: ResPA通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并利用当前梯度与参考梯度的残差捕捉全局扰动方向变化。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA在迁移性上优于现有方法，且与输入变换方法结合可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型的泛化能力，解决了现有方法因数据不足导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限，泛化能力不足，导致在开放世界中的性能下降和不一致。

Method: 提出了GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型的通用知识，并通过知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制动态调整通用知识的指导。

Result: 实验证明GOOD在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过平衡通用性与特异性，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制（UnGuidance）结合LoRA，实现对扩散模型中特定知识的精准遗忘，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型的潜在滥用风险（如生成有害内容）促使需要有效的机器遗忘方法，以在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: UnGuide结合LoRA和动态推理机制（UnGuidance），根据去噪过程的稳定性调整引导尺度，实现选择性遗忘。

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中表现优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持了图像的真实性和模型表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide为扩散模型的精准遗忘提供了有效解决方案，平衡了遗忘效果与内容保真度。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，解决了传统方法在区域选择上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理，但会导致感兴趣区域风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络，结合内部混合技术，精准迁移风格至感兴趣区域。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证，视觉和定量指标均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了区域风格迁移的准确性和视觉效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中存在泛化性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题，MAISI-v2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，下游分割实验验证了合成图像的实用性。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在加速和条件一致性方面表现优异，代码和模型已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，通过MAE策略在大规模脑MRI数据上学习可迁移的潜在表示，适用于分类和分割任务，并在数据有限条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺的问题，提高预训练模型在真实世界中的适用性。

Method: 使用MAE预训练策略在大规模脑MRI数据上学习潜在表示，结合轻量级线性头进行分类任务，提出MAE-FUnet架构融合CNN特征和MAE嵌入进行分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别中达到SOTA准确率，在分割任务中优于基线模型，表现出高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于低资源临床环境和广泛的神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯泼溅风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构并插值实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化泼溅表示，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 生成泼溅表示的隐式表面图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回泼溅。

Result: 实现了快速风格化（2分钟内），支持任意风格图像和3D高斯泼溅，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 该方法高效灵活，适用于多种场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，专为处理多缩放图像集设计，解决了工业检测中高分辨率细节捕捉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节，且多缩放图像会破坏多视角一致性。

Method: MZEN通过引入可学习的缩放因子和新的姿态策略（先解决广角图像，再通过裁剪匹配处理缩放图像）来优化NeRF。

Result: 在多种场景下，MZEN显著提升了PSNR、SSIM，并降低了LPIPS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF扩展到工业检测领域，同时保持全局精度和捕捉微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用效果。

Method: 采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，优化运动变化和内存管理。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA是一种无需微调的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的令牌聚类，显著减少计算量并保持细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有令牌减少方法无法充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA，利用时间相关性优化令牌聚类，避免冗余令牌丢弃。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA显著提升现有方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和领域特定视频中均表现优异，是一种高效优化策略。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的方法，通过自然语言建模驾驶员视线变化，利用少样本和零样本学习，在静态RGB图像上预测驾驶员视觉注意力分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单时刻注意力分配，缺乏动态建模和解释性。本文旨在通过自然语言描述驾驶员视线行为，提升自动驾驶和HCI中的可解释性。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化，微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文（如路线语义、风险预测）生成语言描述。

Result: 微调模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，支持少样本和零样本学习。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现自然语言描述的驾驶员视觉注意力预测，为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，支持下游任务如行为预测和人机协作。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [12] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用多摄像头视角进行视线目标估计（GTE）的方法，通过整合不同视角的信息提高准确性和适用性，解决了单视角方法面临的遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法在面部遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等情况下表现不佳，因此需要一种多视角方法来提升准确性和适用性。

Method: 方法采用双摄像头视角输入，包含头部信息聚合（HIA）模块、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）模块和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块，以优化视线估计。

Result: 该方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角能清晰捕捉面部时表现更佳，且具备仅通过第二视角图像估计第一视角视线目标的能力。

Conclusion: 多视角GTE方法在准确性和功能扩展上优于单视角方法，同时提供了多视角数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新模块和自适应集成模块，动态优化决策边界并减少对提示的依赖，显著提升了模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有的测试时适应方法（TTA）效率有限，尤其是缓存方法仅存储高置信度样本，忽略了其他测试数据的影响。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，同时通过自适应集成模块减少提示依赖，并基于置信度动态结合两模块的分数。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑，能生成多样且语义准确的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以支持开放域场景或灵活编辑，因此需要从文本直接生成高质量3D场景。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析输入文本并生成3D资产，通过空间约束迭代优化布局，支持人类反馈编辑。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0生成的场景在语义和物理布局上优于基线，支持风格一致的对象编辑和布局优化。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0为3D场景生成提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，尤其在游戏建模中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过物理建模和自监督优化，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且未充分利用预训练模型能力的情况下，难以平衡视觉合成与语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并初始化MLLM的视觉生成分支。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合了MLLMs和扩散模型，实现了高效可控的图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定和空间语义推理基准，并微调了Qwen2.5VL-PA模型。

Result: PASG在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注水平，实现了更细粒度的语义-可供性理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene通过统一框架有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画的集成问题，实现了高质量的动态视频生成。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Motivation: 预训练深度补全模型在新环境（目标数据）中因协变量偏移导致预测错误，需一种无需预知目标分布的方法进行适应。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均分别提升10.23%和6.94%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型实现测试时适应，显著提升了深度补全模型在新环境中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，该方法实现了显著加速且性能损失较小。

Conclusion: 所提系统通过优化前端计算和运动估计，显著提升了视频计算机视觉的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保留上取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法在速度和内容一致性上存在不足，InstantEdit旨在通过RectifiedFlow框架和新技术解决这些问题。

Method: 结合PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection和Disentangled Prompt Guidance技术，并集成Canny-conditioned ControlNet以提升编辑效果。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过新技术实现了快速且高质量的文本引导图像编辑，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

*Jian Wang,Chaokang Jiang,Haitao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法受限于Transformer的二次计算复杂性和缺乏空间先验，无法有效处理高分辨率特征和BEV表示。

Method: 采用几何增强的LiDAR表示和门控Mamba融合架构（GM-Fusion），替代Transformer，利用状态空间模型（SSM）实现线性复杂度的长程依赖建模。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive表现优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在自动驾驶任务中，性能和效率均优于通用Transformer。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效整合多模态数据和半监督学习策略，显著提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉特征的高维度导致计算开销大，现有方法在性能或成本上存在不足。

Method: 利用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，通过FFT高效计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上优于现有方法，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上的实验表明，Depth-Jitter虽未在绝对性能上超越传统方法，但显著提升了模型在深度变化下的稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知数据增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且编辑质量受限。

Method: 采用自回归图像生成，预训练任意顺序的自回归文本到图像(T2I)模型，实现零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准上达到新最优性能，支持零样本测试时缩放(TTS)。

Conclusion: NEP方法显著提升了编辑效率和质量，支持灵活的区域编辑和迭代优化。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在泛化性和可解释性上表现不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法和三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性奖励）。

Result: 在域内和域外VQA基准测试中达到最优性能，并在质量理解和描述任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅需分数监督的泛化和可解释VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: LV-Net通过结合解剖关系和顶点分类，提高了LV形状分析的准确性和鲁棒性，为疾病研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a

Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

<details>

Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，由于缺乏颜色信息，导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上有效解决。

Method: 提出TSANet，采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克；引入轻量级Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: 在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上，TSANet在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

<details>

Motivation: 传统观点认为SOD和COD的联合学习会降低网络性能，但作者提出相反观点，认为通过正确方法可以实现双任务协同优化。

Method: 提出SCJoint方案，通过少量任务特定参数学习解码过程的均值和方差，实现任务解耦；引入SBSS平衡训练集并提升质量。

Result: 训练出通用网络JoNet，能同时处理SOD和COD任务，实验证明其竞争力和有效性。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS成功实现双任务联合学习，为相关领域提供新思路。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Motivation: 当前基准测试要么基于静态数据集的真实评分，要么采用模糊的聊天机器人式人类偏好收集，无法提供直观的性能差异反馈。

Method: 采用点光源成像技术，通过生物运动变体的视觉动画进行成对比较评估，收集了超过45k投票。

Result: 数据分析显示众包投票与专家评分一致，90%以上模型（包括前沿的InternVL3和Claude-4系列）无法生成基础人形点光源组。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena 是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准，无需依赖真实数据，提供灵活评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Motivation: 当前治疗TD的方法依赖低分辨率MR扫描和外科医生的经验，手术效果不一致且微创技术应用有限。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）生成超分辨率MR体积，多标签网络分割骨骼，再通过小波扩散模型（WDM）生成伪健康目标形态。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，生成高分辨率3D形态，可作为术前蓝图，提升手术效果。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的编辑（尤其是视频）因训练数据有限而受限，DreamVE旨在通过统一模型和高效数据合成解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略（图像编辑→视频编辑），结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，并设计高效编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，拼贴数据增强泛化能力，生成模型数据补充属性编辑能力。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一模型和多样化数据合成，显著提升了指令驱动的图像和视频编辑性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SwiftVideo的统一稳定蒸馏框架，结合轨迹保留和分布匹配策略，以加速视频生成模型，同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流的视频生成模型需要多次迭代采样，计算开销大；现有蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影。

Method: 提出连续时间一致性蒸馏确保ODE轨迹精确保留，并引入双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，该方法在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo框架在减少推理步骤的同时保持了高质量视频生成，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

TL;DR: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的框架，通过动态文本引导的剪枝机制和跨模态注意力分析，显著降低了视觉语言模型的推理成本，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在推理过程中处理大量视觉标记导致成本高昂，现有剪枝方法未能充分利用动态内部信号。

Method: 提出动态文本引导的剪枝机制，利用层间文本注意力图构建软先验，并结合跨模态注意力分析设计更高效的剪枝策略。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%，在相同标记预算下超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种高效且通用的多模态任务解决方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视频质量评估（VQA）框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习的质量提示词提升性能，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）在质量评估中展现出潜力。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入可学习的质量提示词，并研究帧采样策略对性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在质量评估中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法能生成多样且自然的反应动作，适用于不同情感场景。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Motivation: 数字时代中图像编辑工具的普及威胁了视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，而数据集规模不足限制了模型性能。CIML虽能生成像素级标注，但现有方法流程复杂且低效。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，减少对标注数据的依赖。通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换，并采用端到端设计简化标注流程。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML的F1分数分别比现有方法平均高出9.66（IML）和4.36（CIML），且在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成式框架有效解决了IML和CIML任务的数据依赖问题，性能显著优于现有方法，为图像篡改检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架在跨模态检索中表现出色，具有通用性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中优于现有自监督和全监督基线，验证了渐进注意力机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 自监督学习框架和渐进注意力机制显著提升了手写数学表达式识别的性能。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FMCE-Net++ 显著提升模型性能（如 ResNet-50/CIFAR-10 准确率提升 1.16 pp）。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++ 能有效提升模型性能，无需修改架构或增加数据。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Motivation: 现有开源MLLMs在图表理解任务上的成功率较低（30%-50%），且现有合成图表训练数据与真实图表相似度不足，影响了模型性能。

Method: 设计了五步数据合成流程：分离数据和函数生成、多子图条件生成、视觉多样化、数据质量过滤、以及使用GPT-4生成问答对，构建了包含10k+图表和300k+问答对的ECD数据集。

Result: ECD数据集显著提升了多种MLLMs在真实和合成测试集上的性能。

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化的图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Motivation: 开放词汇场景下的语义分割面临语义类别广泛和细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构造方法，导致语义不对齐和性能不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL作为更强的训练信号，结合FSS重构特征。MCCL通过类别内和类别间对齐与分离增强模型学习能力，FSS通过先验融合和语义激活图增强避免视觉编码器的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如VOC上比SOTA基线高4.5%，Context上高8.9%，Object上高2.6%，City上高2.0%。

Conclusion: SynSeg显著提升了弱监督下的语义定位和区分能力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Conclusion: CAE高效学习潜在空间，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过自我修正机制和精细评估指标，提升了图像字幕的质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Motivation: 评估Segment Anything Model（SAM）的潜在漏洞，避免其成为下游应用的单点风险。

Method: 提出Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack（VeSCA），利用SAM编码器生成对抗样本，通过迭代顶点优化和轻量级域适应策略。

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上比现有方法性能提升12.7%。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D眼球结构的视线重定向框架，通过显式建模眼球旋转和平移，结合自适应变形模块，生成高质量且准确的视线图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经辐射场的方法未显式建模眼球运动，限制了视线重定向的准确性和真实性。

Method: 采用3D高斯点云（3DGS）显式表示眼球结构，结合自适应变形模块模拟眼部肌肉运动。

Result: 在ETH-XGaze数据集上验证，生成图像质量高且视线估计准确，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式3D眼球结构结合自适应变形模块显著提升了视线重定向的效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，结合稀疏IMU和单目摄像头进行实时人体运动捕捉，通过统一框架融合两种信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉信息因遮挡或离开视野导致的退化问题，同时利用IMU的稳定性和时序信息。

Method: 将视觉信息整体转化为条件嵌入，IMU测量逐帧与噪声姿态拼接作为扩散模型输入。

Result: 实验证明系统设计有效，姿态估计性能达到先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉信息退化时仍能保持鲁棒性，IMU的时序信息得到充分利用。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are
available for research at https://shaohua-pan.github.io/diffcap-page.

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，提升评估效果。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖标准卷积，而自适应卷积能更好利用遥感图像的像素相关性。

Result: DSConv能更有效提取特征，提升网络泛化、优化和特征表示能力。

Conclusion: 实验证明DSConv具有高效性和先进性能，适用于图像融合任务。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Motivation: 解决现有T2I评估指标的局限性，提供更全面的评估方法。

Method: 采用两阶段混合范式：确定性指标量化物理属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Result: 指标与人类评估高度一致（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义上达到85.9%准确率。评估显示无通用最优模型，角色加权分数提供领域指导。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供了更全面的工具，资源公开以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右脑皮层结构变化的侧化不对称性。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架显著提升了AD诊断的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Conclusion: PostDiff为扩散模型的后训练加速提供了有效方案，单步优化优于步数减少。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Conclusion: UW-3DGS框架显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和效率，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Conclusion: MA-CBP为城市公共安全风险预警提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Result: 在1622张CT图像上验证，IoU和Dice分数分别达到80.1%和89.0%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著提升了复杂胸腔积液CT图像的分割精度。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Conclusion: LiLoRA是一种高效且可扩展的架构扩展方法，适用于多模态大语言模型的持续视觉指令调优，能够有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过层次化设计和专家多样性模块，实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双手X光片的可解释性图像级SvdH评分预测方法，通过注意力机制和多实例学习提升预测准确性，结果接近放射科专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性未被广泛采用，手动评分效率低，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）提取异常区域；2）基于注意力机制的多实例学习整合特征。提出两种区域提取方案：采样异常图像块或裁剪病变关节区域。

Result: 最佳模型PCC为0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC达0.945，RMSE为15.57，接近专家水平（PCC=0.97，RMSE=18.75）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别与RA进展相关的解剖结构，决策依据符合临床需求，性能优异。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理感知和边缘引导的Transformer（TEFormer），用于城市遥感图像的语义分割，解决了纹理差异和边缘模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地物纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类，同时不规则形状和模糊边界增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕获纹理差异，边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留局部细节，边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文与边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理和边缘引导机制有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法解决了现有方法的局限性，为图像去模糊提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种参数高效的深度伪造检测方法LNCLIP-DF，仅微调预训练CLIP模型的层归一化参数，通过L2归一化和潜在空间增强提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器在面对未见过的伪造技术时泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 微调CLIP模型的层归一化参数（占总参数的0.03%），并使用L2归一化和潜在空间增强优化特征流形。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上取得最优性能，平均跨数据集AUROC超过复杂方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化修改预训练CLIP模型，实现了高效且可复现的深度伪造检测方法。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类中面临通信开销大的问题，FedX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少传输模型大小。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上验证，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量并提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效降低了通信开销，同时优于未剪枝模型和现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在三个数据集六种跨域设置下，URPA仅需少量无标注目标视频即可泛化良好。

Conclusion: URPA是一种高效、实用的无标注跨域视频时间定位方法，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Motivation: 当前弱监督视频异常检测模型在处理复杂异常事件时表现不佳，主要原因是模型无法区分不同异常类别的特征，且弱监督信号缺乏精确的时间信息。

Method: 提出GS-MoE框架，使用一组专家模型分别捕捉特定异常类型，并通过高斯泼溅损失增强时间一致性，最后通过专家混合机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58%的AUC，并在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时间引导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Motivation: 心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致域偏移，限制了AI模型在实际场景中的应用。传统方法如数据增强或迁移学习存在局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成与源域相似的合成心脏MR图像，保持空间和结构一致性。评估了2D/3D nnU-Net和U-Net在域泛化和域适应中的表现。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了未见目标域的分割性能（Welch's t-test, p < 0.01），优于仅使用真实数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需迁移学习或在线训练，有效解决了心脏MR图像分析中的域偏移问题，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Result: 模型能够从未知初始状态中正确推断状态，并在3D数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型更适用于现实场景，无需依赖初始真实状态。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交质量，街景图像作为低成本数据源可能蕴含社交信息。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型分析2998张街景图像，结合线性回归模型控制变量，验证社交性与环境及情感的关系。

Result: 天空视野指数与三种社交性相关，绿化视野指数预测持久社交性，居民情感与短暂社交性正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可推断社交性与城市环境的关系，为跨文化研究和城市设计提供工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决一对多人脸识别中排名第一的结果是否为图库内或图库外的问题，减少误识别和错误逮捕。

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种退化探针图像有效，且在人口统计组间分类准确率相似。

Conclusion: 该方法能客观估计一对多识别是否为图库外，尤其适用于使用高级损失函数训练的匹配器。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅针对单一模态，限制了通用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了仅用文本数据构建通用多模态模型的潜力，具有高度可扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

TL;DR: FVGen通过蒸馏视频扩散模型（VDMs）实现快速新视角合成，仅需四步采样，显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图在3D重建中容易产生伪影，现有方法依赖VDMs生成密集观测但采样速度慢。

Method: 提出FVGen框架，使用GAN和软化反向KL散度最小化，将多步去噪教师模型蒸馏为少步去噪学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在保持（或提升）视觉质量的同时，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的时间效率，适用于需要多次运行VDMs的场景。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

Result: 在多样化下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin作为即插即用组件，兼容多种对比框架，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Result: 在经典（DomainNet）和复杂（GeoNet）域偏移任务中表现优异，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态引导视觉模型适应，显著提升了复杂域偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical

Conclusion: WGAST能够有效捕捉精细尺度的热模式，并对云干扰具有鲁棒性，为高分辨率LST估计提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Conclusion: Lightswitch通过整合固有属性和多视图数据，显著提升了重光照的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

*Abishek Thamma,Micha Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了短暂记忆对语言学习的益处，发现短暂记忆能提升语言模型性能，但会降低对人类阅读时间的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证短暂记忆是否如传统认知科学所认为的那样有助于语言学习，尤其是在Transformer模型中。

Method: 通过对比实验，训练具有和不具有短暂记忆的Transformer模型，评估其语言建模和人类阅读时间预测能力。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言建模性能，但降低了阅读时间预测的准确性，且这一现象无法用现有理论解释。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有益，但对行为预测无益。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [103] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言的大模型（LLM）在预测抑郁评分时，如果直接使用抑郁评估的语言响应（Mirror模型），会因“标准污染”导致效果虚高，泛化性降低。相比之下，使用非直接相关语言（Non-Mirror模型）的预测效果较小但更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Mirror模型因标准污染导致的效果虚高问题，并比较其与非Mirror模型的性能差异，以提高抑郁评分的预测泛化性。

Method: 110名参与者完成结构化诊断和生活史访谈，使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B分别预测抑郁评分，比较Mirror和Non-Mirror模型的效果。

Result: Mirror模型效果虚高（R2=0.80），Non-Mirror模型效果较小但更可靠（R2=0.27）。两者与自报抑郁症状的相关性相同（r≈0.54），表明Mirror模型存在偏差。

Conclusion: Mirror模型因标准污染导致效果虚高，泛化性差。未来抑郁语言模型应结合Non-Mirror模型，以提高可解释性和泛化性。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文重新解读了基于深度神经网络的涌现通信（EmCom）实验，通过小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，并设计了一个类似自然语言屈折形态的新实验，以更贴近自然语言的通信模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EmCom研究过于关注特定子领域目标和指标，导致通信方案偏向一对一属性表示和句法组合，缺乏对自然语言特性的模拟。

Method: 在属性-值重构游戏中引入小词汇量约束，模拟双重分节，并设计新实验以模拟自然语言的屈折形态。提出新指标，探索屈折形态的两种特性：连接性和融合性。

Result: 实验发现，模拟音位约束促进了连接性形态，而涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性，与自然语言特性一致。

Conclusion: 通过模拟自然语言特性，EmCom实验能更真实地反映人类语言的本质，为语言学研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Result: 研究发现不同LLMs在情感推理中表现出多样化的模式，揭示了认知评估维度在情感表征中的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个评估LLMs情感认知推理能力的新框架，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法难以单独评估检索的真实贡献，尤其是LLM作为读者时对提示的敏感性。

Method: 引入Spectrum Projection Score（SPS）指标，通过比较生成令牌与读者子空间主方向形成的面积，衡量检索摘要的语义对齐与相关性。基于SPS开发了动态采样、排序和压缩检索摘要的框架xCompress。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试和四种开源LLM上的实验表明，SPS能提升任务性能，并为检索与生成的交互提供理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS和xCompress为RAG提供了更精细的评估与控制方法，揭示了检索对生成的实际贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

Motivation: 亲社会性检测缺乏明确的定义和标注数据，需要新的方法来解决这一新兴挑战。

Method: 采用LLM标注、人机协作精炼任务定义，并训练两阶段推理系统以降低成本。

Result: 减少了70%的推理成本，同时保持高精度（约0.90）。

Conclusion: 通过人机协作和优化架构设计，实现了对新兴AI任务的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注主题共享特征，忽略了主题特定特征，限制了评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件），结合对抗训练和邻居分类器，生成目标主题的伪标签以指导学习。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的实验表明，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过结合主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题作文评分的性能。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的高计算成本问题，并探索稀疏性是否必然以牺牲模型精度为代价。

Method: 在DistilBERT模型的注意力机制中引入结构化后处理稀疏性，并在SST-2情感分析任务中进行微调。

Result: 80%稀疏性的模型验证精度达91.59%，比密集基线提升0.97%。

Conclusion: 稀疏性不仅是计算效率工具，还能通过隐式正则化提升模型泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝响应时，逐渐缩小了对比样本的表征差异，削弱了偏好学习的效果。

Method: 提出了双阶段框架：1）锚定拒绝（固定初始模型的拒绝响应）；2）未来引导选择（动态筛选未来模型的预测样本）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个模型家族和规模上显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升了9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还展示了在数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务上的优越泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

Motivation: 由于LLMs的知识获取具有随机性，传统探测方法需要多次前向传播，计算成本高且耗时。

Conclusion: PEEK方法可高效识别LLMs的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏差，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

Result: 在三个评估基准上达到SOTA性能，并显著提升生成故事的质量。

Conclusion: EvolvR框架通过自进化方法有效解决了故事评估的难题，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges
(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

TL;DR: LogicRAG提出了一种动态提取推理结构的框架，无需预构建图，显著降低了token成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GraphRAG方法因预构建图导致的高成本和更新延迟问题，并适应不同类型和复杂度的查询需求。

Method: 通过分解查询为子问题并构建DAG，动态提取推理结构，结合拓扑排序和图剪枝优化检索。

Result: 实验表明LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG通过动态推理结构实现了高效且准确的检索增强生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Sayantan Adak,Pratyush Chatterjee,Somnath Banerjee,Rima Hazra,Somak Aditya,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过多层次的Process Reward Models（PRMs）解决LLMs在逻辑推理中的安全风险，显著提升输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理中容易忽视隐含的安全风险，传统方法（如奖励模型或启发式解码）缺乏细粒度和主动性。

Method: 引入AURA框架，结合自省式自我批判、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全感知解码，动态引导模型推理。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为更安全、负责任的AI设定了新基准，推动了对齐敏感应用的发展。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性反思蒸馏（SRD）的新框架，通过动态评估和选择高质量、学生兼容的训练数据，提升知识蒸馏（KD）的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒KD方法忽视了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: SRD利用学生模型的反思动态评估和选择训练数据，并采用课程调度策略逐步引入数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD能提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少高达39%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是高效KD的关键，SRD为压缩LLMs提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成过程中可能出现的隐性刻板印象问题，揭示模型输出中不易通过显性语言特征捕捉的隐藏社会偏见。

Method: 结合嵌套语义表示与上下文对比机制，提取潜在偏见特征；利用注意力权重扰动分析模型对特定社会属性术语的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高可解释性和实用性，为偏见检测提供了透明可靠的技术基础，适用于需要高可信生成内容的实际应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

TL;DR: TADrop是一种自适应稀疏化策略，通过为每个参数张量分配定制化的稀疏率，优化模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏率，忽视了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误删。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性分配稀疏率，密集冗余的张量被大幅修剪，稀疏关键的张量被保留。

Result: 实验表明，TADrop显著提升了多种任务和模型的性能，例如在8个ViT-B/32任务中平均提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过定制化稀疏化有效减少参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中RAG和RLVR能力孤立发展，限制了泛化性和应用范围，UR2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出难度感知课程训练和混合知识访问策略，结合离线语料库与LLM生成摘要。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini的性能。

Conclusion: UR2为统一检索与推理提供了通用框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在交流中的普及，传统语用学理论需调整以适应机器为中心的通信模式。

Method: 通过分析传统语用学的局限性，提出HMC框架和概率语用学（如理性言语行为框架）作为更优解。

Result: 揭示了LLMs对语用学理论的颠覆性影响，提出语境挫折概念描述用户与模型的互动困境。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需扩展以涵盖生成式AI的通信场景，强调人机协作的语用条件构建。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Motivation: 解决LLM在少量数据下更新知识的挑战，并研究灾难性遗忘现象。

Result: 继续预训练效果有限，而多样化的文本变体显著提升学习能力；RAG方法在控制数据集上表现较差。

Conclusion: 模型可以生成有效的合成训练数据，为有限数据下的知识注入提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言理解方面表现优异，但医疗领域需要更精准和动态的知识整合。DKG-LLM旨在通过动态知识图谱解决这一问题。

Method: 采用动态知识图谱（DKG）与Grok 3 LLM结合，利用自适应语义融合算法（ASFA）整合异构医疗数据，动态更新图谱。

Result: DKG-LLM在MIMIC-III和PubMed数据集上表现优异，诊断准确率达84.19%，治疗推荐准确率达89.63%，语义覆盖率达93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一个可靠且具有变革性的工具，能够处理复杂医疗数据并支持基于医生反馈的学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱评估方法多为二元分类或多维度框架，但存在场景适应性差和评估精度不足的问题。

Method: 提出SceneJailEval框架，包含场景自适应多维度评估方法和一个14场景的数据集。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最优性能，F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval在越狱评估中表现出色，具有场景适应性和扩展性优势。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Method: 提出四层EI分类法，开发EICAP-Bench基准测试，评估六种LLMs，并通过LoRA适配器在UltraChat数据集上微调Qwen2.5模型。

Result: Qwen2.5-Instruct表现最佳，微调仅在Appraisal层显著提升EI能力。

Conclusion: 现有预训练和指令调优方法在提升LLMs情感推理能力方面存在不足，需针对性改进。

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the
development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified,
psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language
models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and
emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的内容分类方法，用于动态适应政策变化的内容审核，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统难以快速适应政策变化，需频繁重新训练。RAG方法通过检索上下文知识实现灵活分类。

Method: 使用Contextual Policy Engine（CPE），一种基于RAG的系统，将分类任务转化为基于检索到的政策内容进行评估。

Result: 实验表明CPE在分类准确性、可解释性和动态政策更新方面表现优异，且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: RAG方法使内容分类更灵活、透明和适应性强，适用于内容审核及其他分类问题。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在因果推理方面的能力，填补多模态环境中这一核心认知能力的空白。

Method: 设计了包含定量和语义因果推理任务的InfoCausalQA基准，使用GPT-4生成高质量QA对，并通过人工修订确保问题需要视觉基础。

Result: 当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现较差，与人类能力差距显著。

Conclusion: InfoCausalQA揭示了多模态AI系统在因果推理能力上的不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型的方法，用于德语老年人的语音意图识别，利用LLM生成合成数据提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音意图识别方法多针对英语和短命令，本文旨在解决德语老年人语音识别的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型，利用LeoLM、Llama3和ChatGPT生成合成数据，并通过TTS模型生成语音进行测试。

Result: 合成数据显著提升分类性能，LeoLM在德语意图识别中表现优于ChatGPT。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补低资源领域的数据缺口，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDIR的新方法，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）中的抄袭行为，解决了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权（IP）问题日益突出，现有抄袭检测方法在权重对应重建、统计显著性计算等方面存在缺陷。

Method: MDIR利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论，无需完整模型推理即可准确重建权重关系并提供严格的p值估计。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR能可靠检测经过随机置换和持续预训练等变换的抄袭行为，且在一小时内即可完成检测。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效且易于使用的LLM抄袭检测方法。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

TL;DR: 论文提出DynamicTRF框架，通过动态选择适合的图表示形式（TRF）提升多模态模型在零样本图问答任务中的准确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用单一图表示形式（TRF），未能考虑不同模型或任务的偏好，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Method: 分析现有TRF的优缺点，设计适合零样本图问答的TRF集合$F_{ZS}$，提出新指标GRE衡量性能与简洁性，开发DynamicTRF框架动态选择最佳TRF。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图问答任务和2个领域外任务中，DynamicTRF显著提升了零样本图问答的准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态TRF选择和GRE指标，有效提升了多模态模型在图问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过将攻击性检测作为辅助任务集成到统一训练框架中，是否能提升大语言模型（LLMs）在社交媒体网络欺凌检测中的泛化能力和性能。实验表明，通过丰富提示管道方法，模型表现优于标准LoRA微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的网络欺凌检测因其表达隐晦多样而具有挑战性，研究旨在探索辅助任务（如攻击性检测）是否能提升LLMs在此任务中的性能。

Method: 使用指令调优的LLMs，在五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集上评估了零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调和多任务学习（MTL）策略，并提出了丰富提示管道方法。

Result: 丰富提示管道方法在性能上优于标准LoRA微调，表明攻击性检测提供的上下文信息能显著提升网络欺凌检测效果。

Conclusion: 辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可有效提升LLMs在安全关键应用（如网络欺凌检测）中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

TL;DR: 研究结合大型语言模型（LLMs）的角色扮演和情感支持能力，创建了ChatAnime数据集，评估LLMs在情感支持角色扮演（ESRP）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分结合LLMs的角色扮演和情感支持能力，尤其在虚拟角色互动中。

Method: 选择20个动漫角色，设计60个情感场景问题，收集40名动漫爱好者和10个LLMs的对话数据，设计9个细粒度指标评估。

Result: 表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上仍占优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为优化LLMs在ESRP中的表现提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at

TL;DR: SecMCP是一个安全框架，通过检测和量化对话漂移来增强MCP的安全性，解决现有防御方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP在增强LLMs时引入安全风险，现有防御方法效果有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: SecMCP利用潜在多面体空间建模LLM激活向量，检测异常对话动态。

Result: 在多个LLMs和数据集上验证，AUROC分数超过0.915，系统实用性良好。

Conclusion: SecMCP有效解决了MCP的安全威胁，为对话漂移提供了量化方法。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代理在程序记忆上存在脆弱性，依赖手动设计或静态参数，限制了其灵活性和适应性。

Method: 提出Memp方法，通过构建、检索和更新策略，将代理轨迹转化为细粒度指令和高级抽象，并动态更新记忆库。

Result: 实验表明，随着记忆库的优化，代理在类似任务上的成功率和效率逐步提升，且记忆迁移到较弱模型仍能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: Memp方法有效增强了代理的程序记忆能力，支持终身学习和性能迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: 跨语言任务无需大量多语言训练，轻量干预可纠正偏见，开源模型提供高效低成本替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

Conclusion: 生成式AI在新闻写作中的应用日益广泛，虽提升了效率，但也带来了风格趋同和正式性下降的问题。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns
for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated
content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Motivation: 长上下文推理对LLMs计算需求高，现有方法效率有限。

Method: 提出SlimInfer框架，动态剪枝隐藏状态中的冗余令牌，利用信息扩散现象。

Result: 实验显示TTFT加速2.53倍，端到端延迟降低1.88倍。

Conclusion: SlimInfer高效且不影响性能，适用于长上下文推理。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>

Motivation: 触觉信号在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有重要意义，但此前多模态研究主要集中于视觉和听觉，触觉信号研究不足。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，采用两种触觉分词器（基于频率和EnCodec），通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）实现触觉信号的描述生成。

Result: HapticLLaMA在触觉振动信号解释上表现优异，METEOR得分59.98，BLEU-4得分32.06，61%以上生成描述获人类评分超过3.5（7分制）。

Conclusion: 研究表明大型语言模型具备处理和适应感官数据的潜力，强化学习进一步提升了与人类触觉感知的匹配度。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

Motivation: 人类在多轮交互中能高效适应语言并形成临时约定，而现有LLMs缺乏这种能力。

Method: 通过启发式识别的约定形成演示进行针对性微调，并设计两个新基准（交互任务和文档参考完成任务）评估。

Result: 后训练的LLMs在两个评估方法中表现出显著提升的约定形成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs在多轮交互中的约定形成能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

### [143] [GPU-Accelerated Barrier-Rate Guided MPPI Control for Tractor-Trailer Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05773)
*Keyvan Majd,Hardik Parwana,Bardh Hoxha,Steven Hong,Hideki Okamoto,Georgios Fainekos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BR-MPPI方法通过结合控制屏障函数（CBF）约束，改进了MPPI控制，提高了在复杂环境中导航的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接式车辆（如拖车、堆场卡车等）在拥挤空间中反向和机动时的导航问题，尤其是在有行人的环境中。

Method: 将CBF约束直接嵌入路径积分更新中，引导重要性采样分布朝向无碰撞且动态可行的轨迹。

Result: 在高保真CarMaker模拟器中测试，BR-MPPI在单GPU上以超过100Hz的速度计算控制输入，比标准MPPI和带碰撞成本的MPPI基线表现更好。

Conclusion: BR-MPPI显著提升了MPPI的探索能力和轨迹鲁棒性，适用于复杂环境中的车辆导航。

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Conclusion: 模块化真空夹具系统在小家电拆卸任务中表现优越，为复杂几何形状的物体提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

directions in a virtual environment, both derived from the object's geometry,
to address occlusions and structural complexity. To prevent excessive position

TL;DR: LPB框架通过分离专家模仿和OOD恢复，提升视觉运动策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆训练的视觉运动策略对协变量偏移敏感，现有方法依赖人工干预或数据增强，成本高或效果有限。

Method: LPB将专家演示的潜在嵌入作为隐式屏障，分为基础扩散策略和动态模型两部分，前者专注专家数据，后者预测未来状态。

Result: 实验表明，LPB在模拟和真实场景中均提高了策略鲁棒性和数据效率。

Conclusion: LPB无需额外人工干预即可实现可靠的操控，适用于有限专家数据场景。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

institution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas
du Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and
Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides
supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as
telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums
remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了双模态车辆在复杂环境中的轨迹规划鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖于固定滑动窗口集成，难以适应多样化的运动尺度和步频，且不确定性不一致，限制了实际应用。

Method: ReNiL结合了运动感知方向滤波器和Any-Scale Laplace Estimator（ASLE），通过IPDPs在上下文有意义的路点估计运动，支持任意尺度的IMU序列推理。

Result: 在RoNIN-ds和WUDataset上，ReNiL在位移精度和不确定性一致性上达到最先进水平，优于TLIO、CTIN、iMoT和RoNIN变体，同时减少了计算量。

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和IoT定位提供了可扩展且具有不确定性感知的基础，展示了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

Conclusion: 增量语言理解与实时运动规划结合，提升人机协作的自然性和流畅性。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有技术，提升了模型规划的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率的同时提升了动态预测能力，为机器人控制提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Affordance-R1是首个结合GRPO强化学习和推理的affordance推理框架，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for
manipulators. The necessary inputs for the library are Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters, link masses, and centers of mass. Additionally, our model is
data-driven and requires real operational data, including joint positions,
velocities, accelerations, electrical power, and corresponding timestamps. We
validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from
three distinct manufacturers: Universal Robots, Franka Emika, and Kinova. The
model underwent testing, and the results demonstrated an RMSE ranging from 1.42
W to 2.80 W for the training dataset and from 1.45 W to 5.25 W for the testing
dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPR-AKG的语义模型，用于分析和缓解工业4.0中灵活生产系统的异常情况，结合了语义技术和大型语言模型，并通过电动汽车电池再制造的案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0的灵活性导致传统质量保证机制失效，需要新的方法来分析和缓解生产中的异常情况。

Method: 基于PPR模型，开发了PPR-AKG语义模型，结合OWL本体和大型语言模型，提供自然语言交互接口。

Result: PPR-AKG在电动汽车电池再制造案例中有效支持资源分配和异常情况的识别与缓解。

Conclusion: PPR-AKG模型及其与大型语言模型的结合为工业4.0生产系统提供了高效的分析和交互工具。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of
robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

TL;DR: S-Path利用3D场景图的语义结构提升路径规划效率，通过两阶段规划和动态重规划机制，显著减少规划时间并保持路径最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D场景图的语义结构未被充分利用，影响了路径规划的效率和可解释性。

Method: 采用两阶段规划：先在语义图上搜索高层路径，再分解为并行子问题；引入动态重规划机制优化效率。

Result: 实验显示，S-Path平均减少5.7倍规划时间，路径最优性与传统方法相当，复杂场景表现更优。

Conclusion: S-Path是一种高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于室内3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种交互式机器人任务，仅需原始图像数据。

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

Result: 实验案例展示了四种不同策略的程序在UR5e机器人上的表现，揭示了各策略的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化机器人编程提供了实用见解，支持可持续制造和成本降低等工业目标。

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Conclusion: 研究表明，增强的线性执行器模型与VDC结合，可实现全电动HDRM的模块化实时控制，适用于未来移动工作机器。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

Conclusion: 重新平衡数据集能有效改善模仿学习算法的性能，但不同方法各有优缺点，需根据场景选择。

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

Conclusion: 该框架简化了部署，无需高质量初始外参，可直接从常规操作数据中完成标定。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

Conclusion: V*通过直接集成动态和运动学约束，显著提升了运动规划的效率和可行性，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at
