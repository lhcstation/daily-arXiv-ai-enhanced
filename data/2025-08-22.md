### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于热图回归的面部关键点检测方法普遍使用Soft-argmax作为argmax的可微分近似，但这种方法并非唯一选择，作者希望探索更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标，替代传统的Soft-argmax方法，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍，同时保持更好或相当的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非实现高性能面部关键点检测的唯一方法，基于结构化预测的替代方案在收敛速度和准确率方面都表现出优势，为相关研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图像分类方法，通过结合图卷积神经网络(GCN)和Voronoi图来优化图像表示，在多个标准数据集上实现了更高的分类精度和处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络(CNN)在处理复杂数据结构时有限，需要更有效的方法来模型图像中的关系数据。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Delaunay三角剖分来优化图表示，然后通过GCN进行分类。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上超越了最先进方法，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结合GCN和Voronoi图的方法为图像分类提供了新视角，扩展了图基学习在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计统一到2D检测中，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要简化流程并开发仅使用RGB图像的类别级姿态估计方法。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB方法并接近RGB-D系统性能。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB方法可以统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计，无需额外数据就能达到优异性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 统一的面部反欺版识别框架，通过对比学习抓取跨模态的生命力特征，同时处理物理和数字攻击，达到2.10%的平均分类错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代面部识别系统仍容易受到物理和数字欺版攻击。传统方法需要使用不同模型分别处理这两类攻击，导致系统复杂性增加、推理延迟以及无法处理结合攻击。

Method: 提出Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，一种统一训练方法。该框架利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍图对，通过对比学习来获取不依赖于模态的生命力线索。

Result: 在第6届面部反欺版挑战统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，方法达到2.10%的平均分类错误率(ACER)，超过了之前的解决方案。框架轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间少于一小时。

Conclusion: 该统一框架能够高效地同时处理物理和数字面部欺版攻击，具有较高的识别准确性和轻量化特点，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型中高效生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击通常产生低质量图像且需要大量计算资源，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百个采样步骤，需要开发更高效的对抗生成方法

Method: 提出在混合步骤区间注入扰动的方法，开发选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动，在保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，TAIGen对VGGNet源模型的攻击成功率分别为：ResNet 70.6%、MNASNet 80.8%、ShuffleNet 97.8%；PSNR超过30dB保持视觉质量；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍

Conclusion: TAIGen实现了最低的鲁棒准确率，表明这是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制最难净化TAIGen生成的图像

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在mask和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并利用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要局限于mask域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在局限。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE、CARE和FINE三个模块，分别处理mask域、RGB域和最终细化。

Result: 提出了针对不确定区域的Bernoulli扩散模型，显著减少误报和漏报，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RUN++建立了鲁棒CVP系统的新范式，在真实世界退化条件下仍保持有效性，并扩展为双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Conclusion: GasTwinFormer通过有效利用饮食-排放相关性，为实时牲畜排放监测提供了实用解决方案，消融研究验证了各架构组件的有效性。

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow是一个新颖的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响生成图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过直接将曲率指导纳入流路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成方面达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量，证明了非线性轨迹在提升语义对齐方面的重要性。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和质量对齐方法，仅使用输入图像就能预测质量分数，无需参考图像或辅助模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或推理时辅助模态的方法。

Method: 提出分层排序和质量对齐框架，结合排序学习和对比学习。使用高阶排序损失监督质量预测，嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致，并通过结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景，在镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光等多种失真条件下表现优异。轻量级变体HiRQA-S每张图像推理时间仅3.5ms。

Conclusion: HiRQA在合成和真实基准测试中展现出最先进的性能、强大的泛化能力和可扩展性，为实时部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在时空相关中断情况下保证多视角3D重建的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应急响应、战术场景等关键应用需要近实时3D重建，但边缘环境的动态性和操作逆境会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的方法，通过遗传算法解决优化问题，选择最优相机组合以应对时空相关中断

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统基线策略能更好地保证3D重建的可靠性

Conclusion: 所提出的相机选择策略能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保多视角3D重建的质量和可靠性

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM能够通过提供可靠且可解释的见解，弥合自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,Rüdiger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeSS方法使用城市网格模型作为几何先验，通过改进的图像扩散模型生成高质量、风格一致的室外3D场景，包含三个关键阶段：几何一致稀疏视图生成、密集中间视图传播和全局一致性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理，限制了在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。现有图像和视频扩散模型在3D场景生成方面存在局限性，无法保证跨视图一致性和几何对齐。

Method: 提出三阶段管道：1)使用级联外绘ControlNet生成几何一致稀疏视图；2)通过AGInpaint组件传播更密集的中间视图；3)使用GCAlign模块全局消除视觉不一致性。同时基于网格表面初始化3D高斯溅射场景重建。

Result: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法，生成的场景可通过重照明和风格迁移技术以不同风格渲染。

Conclusion: MeSS成功解决了城市网格模型纹理缺失问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景生成解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SurgWound数据集，第一个包含多种手术伤口类型的开源数据集，并建立了手术伤口诊断的基准测诅，包括VQA和报告生成任务。还提出了三阶段学习框架WoundQwen来进行手术伤口诊断和生成综合报告。


<details>

Conclusion: 这项研究为手术伤口诊断领域提供了重要的数据集和模型框架，有助于推动个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者结果，解决了该领域中数据隐私和注释成本高的挑战。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM是首个基于多模态数据（RGB、RGBD、点云）的前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过协作多模态编码和triplane潜在扩散模型，有效整合不同模态的优势，在少量训练数据下实现高质量的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，且受限于3D结构数据，训练数据集规模有限。需要一种能够全面利用多模态数据进行3D建模的方法。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码，整合模态特定特征同时保持各自表征优势；2）采用辅助2D和3D监督提升多模态编码的鲁棒性和性能；3）基于嵌入的多模态代码，使用triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在使用少量训练数据的情况下，实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能。在RGB-D数据集上的额外实验验证了整合其他多模态数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM成功证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的价值，通过协作多模态编码和扩散模型，能够生成纹理和几何细节都更优越的3D资产，为多模态3D生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差，需要更有效的原型计算方法

Method: 软原型对比模块使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型；双重一致性学习模块对齐同一样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法(SOTA)具有有效性

Conclusion: 该方法通过软原型计算和双重一致性学习，有效解决了类间冲突和原型漂移问题，提升了聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度协同VLN任务有效解决了单一无人机在长距离导航中的挑战，通过高低空机的互补优势实现了高效的环境推理和精确导航，为空中自主导航提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，通过马尔可夫方式实现扩散模型加速采样，证明这是预训练扩散模型的内在属性，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中达到SOTA效果，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否以马尔可夫方式实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，与传统逐步细化方法形成对比。该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标，证明通过马尔可夫方式的加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。还将该加速采样技术与DDIM结合提出增强生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样机制是扩散模型加速采样的有效方法，证明了通过马尔可夫方式实现高效采样是预训练扩散模型的内在能力，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了重要的效率提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Result: Comp-X能高效理解编码请求，具备出色的文本交互能力，在单一编码框架下保持可比压缩性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像压缩领域的人工通用智能提供了有前景的发展方向，实现了智能化的用户交互体验。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Conclusion: 冗余分配策略通过数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，提升了自动驾驶中的车道拓扑推理能力

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

TL;DR: TPA是一个用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的框架，结合了时间建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心功能评估方面取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频中的先天性心脏病检测受到图像噪声和探头位置变异性的影响，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时间信息、仅限于二元分类且不考虑预测校准问题。

Method: 提出Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取视频帧特征，可训练时间提取器聚合特征捕获心脏运动，并通过边界铰链对比损失将视频表示与类别特定文本提示对齐。引入CVAESM模块学习潜在风格向量来调节嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时间建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for

leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG是一个无需训练的两阶段伪装目标检测方法，首先通过检索增强生成粗掩码作为提示，然后使用SAM进行精细分割，在个人笔记本上实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示且难以直接处理COD任务，手动生成提示成本高且低效。

Method: 提出RAG-SEG两阶段范式：1）通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩码提示；2）使用SAM2进行精细分割。完全无需传统训练过程。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上达到或超越最先进方法的性能，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算高效性和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效伪装目标检测解决方案，通过检索增强和SAM分割的结合，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整和抗干扰噪声引导技术，有效防止文本到视频扩散模型生成不良内容，在多个擦除任务中平均减少46%的不良内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全问题，这些模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，需要一种有效的方法来控制不良内容的生成。

Method: 提出VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段过程：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块与现有T2V扩散模型无缝集成。

Result: 在对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务中，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案，能够显著抑制T2V扩散模型中不良内容的生成，在多个评估维度上达到最先进性能。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本文通过注意力敲除技术系统分析Video-LLMs内部机制，发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成感知编码和抽象推理的两阶段过程，中间层对视频问答有重要影响，时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，本文旨在通过系统实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），在不同层数窗口上应用，设置全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段处理过程；某些中间层对视频问答有重要影响；时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率方面的见解，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高，需要更高效的迁移学习策略。

Method: 使用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，集中优化目标任务的性能，减少训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过选择性层微调，BioTune降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法存在两个限制：(1)只能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节范围，对大规模场景不实用；(2)缺乏长期归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 提出图像条件高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨所有训练场景的共享码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于解码时图像的场景重建

Result: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了压缩效率并提供了归档后场景变化的适应性，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽略了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景分为近、中、远区域以增强近距离细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯来建模非刚性动态物体，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验对整个框架进行监督，提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的严格评估表明，该方法在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: 互信息最大化存在限制，需要重新考虑模型训练目标和方法来真正提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过SNN和变分推理的结合，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和语义连贯性，同时降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Result: 研究发现掩码比例和补丁大小可以控制MAE学习短程和长程空间相关性特征，MAE表示能够适应超越二阶统计量的数据集空间相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，揭示了MAE学习空间相关性的机制。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时序信息传播有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Conclusion: YOLOv8m-t42模型在检测微小表面缺陷方面具有高精度和实用性，虽然收敛速度较慢，但更适合实际凹陷检测应用，可用于自动化保险评估和汽车检测。

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

TL;DR: MATR模型通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频到视频时刻检索任务中显著提升了性能，在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索(Vid2VidMR)需要语义帧级对齐和建模查询视频与目标视频间的复杂依赖关系，现有方法面临挑战

Method: 提出MATR模型，基于Transformer架构，采用双阶段序列对齐编码相关性，结合前景/背景分类和边界预测头，并使用自监督预训练技术进行任务特定初始化

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在新提出的SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频时刻检索任务中取得了显著的性能提升，证明了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯溅射方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，在极稀疏视角下SfM初始化失败导致渲染质量下降

Method: 提出稠密立体模块逐步估计相机位姿并重建全局稠密点云；设计一致视角插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅2个训练视角）PSNR提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极稀疏视角下的3D重建问题，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均取得显著改进

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一个轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过局部和全局双多尺度设计，在保持低计算开销的同时实现了最先进的性能，并在零样本泛化测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中因追求效率而牺牲性能、缺乏全局上下文感知能力以及忽略通道冗余问题，特别是在资源受限的临床环境中对轻量且通用模型的需求。

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息，实现局部和全局双多尺度特征提取。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上的实验表明，LGMSNet超越了现有最先进方法，特别是在四个未见数据集上的零样本泛化测试中保持了优异性能。

Conclusion: LGMSNet展现了在资源受限医疗场景中实际部署的潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像重建穿衣人体3D模型的新方法，通过联合多视角身体优化算法和法线图集成，显著提升了单视角方法的几何和姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角3D人体重建方法(如ECON)在几何细节和身体姿态估计上存在局限，需要利用多视角信息来提升重建质量和一致性。

Method: 提出JMBO算法联合优化SMPL-X身体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过前后视角法线图集成添加几何细节。

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线显著提升重建保真度，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力，且无需重新训练网络。

Conclusion: MExECON成功将单视角方法扩展到多视角场景，通过有效的多视角一致性约束和细节增强机制，实现了高质量的穿衣人体3D重建。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习实现任务通用性，包含自适应小波变换和空间频率Mamba块两大创新，在多个融合任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种能够处理不同场景和任务的通用融合框架。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，通过可学习映射动态调整实现鲁棒融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的大量实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过自适应频率分离和跨域融合机制，有效改善了多模态特征对齐和整合，减少了频率损失并保留了关键细节，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法利用生成先验作为伪地面真值，但往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示、用于处理远距离物体的Far Field Gaussians，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性地集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、不同多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。首先交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；然后使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)预测组特定位移场，利用文本到视频模型的先验知识进行细化，并包含上下文条件特征增强(CCFE)等模块提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，为处理复杂多对象交互提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个针对高分辨率遥感影像中狭窄道路提取的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力机制和双流解码融合，在复杂场景下实现了精细道路结构分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感影像中狭窄道路提取的挑战，包括道路宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化、频繁遮挡等问题。传统模型容易过拟合到通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块（DADE）增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制（DDFM）整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度扩张策略（率1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度狭窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件分布，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在各种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，这影响了决策边界的可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将测试时自适应重构为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐步更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无需训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在似然偏差。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示在处理高频细节时存在频谱偏差问题，传统方法主要通过架构修改或特殊激活函数来解决，本文探索通过直接指导训练过程的新方向

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；第二阶段转为全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法在旋转轴已知的情况下显著提高了点云配准的计算效率，虽然目前不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在特定场景下具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频LLM，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，解决了现有视频LLM在时间感知精度上的不足，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得了显著进展，但在时间感知方面仍然粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码，帧级特征在捕捉连续性方面较弱，语言视觉对齐经常偏离感兴趣的实体。

Method: 1. 扩散时间潜在（DTL）编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2. 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据，加强对齐；3. 混合令牌方案使用离散时间令牌提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的成果，验证了其强大的接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三项关键创新设计，成功克服了现有视频LLM在时间感知精度方面的限制，为细粒度时间推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但存在数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，人类操作员进行质量评级，训练评分模型分类分割输出，最后用评分模型的反馈微调分割模型

Result: 原始分割模型在正确识别树实例方面提升34%，同时显著减少了非树实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据标注成本高的问题，但在稀疏林区小树（低于2米）或复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中性能仍有待提升

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成有效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法需要模型参数或输出信息，因此需要研究无需目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，提出CFG方法：通过计算提取特征的重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差程度保证不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD是一个多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架，通过教师-教练-学生范式将多模态模型的知识转移到轻量级视觉学生模型中，显著提升在线高清地图构建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线高清地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致计算开销大且依赖过时地图信息。需要开发更高效、低成本的纯视觉解决方案。

Method: 提出MapKD框架：1）多模态教师模型（相机-LiDAR融合+SD/HD地图先验）；2）视觉教练模型（带先验知识和模拟LiDAR）；3）轻量级学生模型。采用TGPD和MSRD两种蒸馏策略进行特征对齐和语义学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型性能提升+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时推理速度加快。

Conclusion: MapKD成功实现了从多模态模型到纯视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线地图构建解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细立面元素，而LoD3模型需要手动建模，难以大规模应用，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 使用冲突映射(CMs)进行射线到模型先验分析，开发语义冲突映射生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs，结合纹理模型分割进行不确定性感知融合

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能有效分割和重建建筑开口，通过纹理分割融合达到61%的性能提升

Conclusion: CM2LoD3方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展的高效3D城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多维动态提示路由(MDPR)框架，用于解决预训练视觉-语言模型在类别不平衡场景下细调时的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉-语言模型在类别不平衡场景下细调时存在偏见问题，而现有方法忽视了模型预训练阶段的内在不平衡性，导致偏见积累。

Method: 构建五个视觉-语义维度的类别知识库，通过动态路由机制对准全局视觉类别、检索最优提示并平衡细粒度语义，最终通过logits融合产生稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾分布数据集上达到了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，而且动态路由机制的计算开销很小。

Conclusion: MDPR框架能够有效减少类别不平衡导致的偏见，为VLM在数据不平衡条件下的细调提供了灵活且高效的增强方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种面向流式视频理解的查询无关KV缓存记忆机制，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，不适用于长视频理解和多轮对话场景

Method: 提出StreamMem机制，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token与通用查询token之间的注意力分数来压缩KV缓存，并维持固定大小的KV记忆

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频流式理解提供了一种高效的内存管理解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存开销

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中物体结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的结构性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的大量实验表明，WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割（如特定核亚型识别）方面存在挑战，需要开发能够更好处理病理图像中特定细胞类型的方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1) 分子赋能的标注参与减少像素级标注需求；2) 使用SAM适配器强调特定语义；3) 整合分子导向校正学习(MOCL)提升分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻了标注人员的工作负担，还将精确生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限的环境，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化进程。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中外骨骼与软组织之间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 从600k高分辨率扫描数据学习，使用240个同步相机捕获。显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过骨骼基础的解耦实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

TL;DR: CineScale是一个无需调优的推理范式，能够实现更高分辨率的视觉生成，支持8K图像生成和4K视频生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉扩散模型由于训练数据分辨率有限和计算资源约束，难以生成高质量的高分辨率图像和视频，现有方法容易产生重复模式

Method: 提出CineScale推理范式，针对不同类型的视频生成架构设计专用变体，支持高分辨率T2I、T2V、I2V和V2V合成

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，实现无需微调的8K图像生成和最小LoRA微调的4K视频生成

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量，扩展了预训练模型的高分辨率生成能力

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

TL;DR: 通过单一SFT阶段的统一同训练框架，实现多种安全行为的动态激活和精细控制，在保持安全性能的同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM内容安全方法存在的多阶段训练流程复杂、缺乏部署后精细控制能力的问题

Method: 统一同训练框架，在单一SFT阶段集成正向（合规/社会良好）、负向（无过滤/风险倾向）和拒绝向（拒绝导向/保守）三种安全行为，通过系统指令或魔法标记动态激活

Result: 8B模型在安全性能上超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，与SFT+DPO方法相当的安全对齐质量，同时显著降低训练复杂度和部署成本

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，通过安全对齐边际实现了削前的精细控制能力

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Method: 使用自动评估指标对WMT25通用机器翻译共享任务的系统进行初步排名

Result: 生成了基于自动指标的初步系统排名，但指出该排名可能对采用质量估计重排序或最小贝叶斯风险解码等重排序技术的系统存在偏差

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本土化框架，自动生成包含本土实体的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决现有翻译数据集中英语中心实体偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言和文化基础的数学推理在低资源语言中落后于英语，主要因为缺乏反映本土实体的社会文化任务数据集。现有多语言标准数据集主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心的实体，影响了真实的多语言数学能力评估。

Method: 提出一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够自动从现有数据源构建包含本土名称、组织名称和货币等实体的数据集。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证，该框架能够帮助减少英语中心实体偏差，并在各种语言中引入本土实体时提高模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: 翻译的标准数据集可能隐藏了真实的多语言数学能力，而本文提出的框架能够有效地构建具有适当社会文化上下文的本土化数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用相对较少但易于生成的数据资源来改进通用指令调优大语言模型的机器翻译能力，特别是针对斯洛文尼亚语这样的低资源语言

Method: 使用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)方法，通过程序化筛选公共数据集并增强的子集进行训练。生成训练数据时使用两个LLM（GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct）翻译英文维基百科文章，基于启发式规则和COMET等自动评估指标对翻译结果进行质量排序

Result: 微调后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时，COMET得分分别比两个基线模型提高了约0.04和0.02，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误

Conclusion: DPO训练方法能够有效利用程序化筛选的数据资源显著提升大语言模型的机器翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言场景下表现出色

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话式可解释AI系统在英语意图识别方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL覆盖5种语言；提出新的解析方法；构建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取；使用多种LLM和BERT模型进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的解析性能；在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估，比较了不同规模模型的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有助于提升多语言ConvXAI系统的意图识别能力，特别是在低资源语言和自定义输入场景下的性能。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但带来巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用奖励偏移推测采样算法，让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布，利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复RLHF最优解。

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，该算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的黄金奖励分数，验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SSS算法成功解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过创新的分布偏移利用方法，实现了高效且有效的LLM对齐，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易产生错误，LLM评估方法也存在对齐问题和幻觉

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配 3)通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长形式QA基准测试中，相比强基线方法在召回准确性上有显著提升

Conclusion: LongRecall为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建块，能减少假阳性和假阴性，适应不同的表达方式和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在各种语言任务中表现出色，但由于自回归特性，容易产生幻觉和复杂推理问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中缺乏结构一致性。

Method: 结合LLM与组合推理方法，研究不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度值用于符号推理，并通过校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上增加符号推理都能产生更一致和准确的预测，结构化学习能显著提升挑战性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 符号推理能有效弥补LLM的结构一致性不足，结构化学习在大语言模型时代仍然具有重要价值，两者结合能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集由于脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保存数学结构而导致质量下降，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据。

Method: 使用布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的针对性清理阶段的新颖管道，能够恢复各种格式的数学内容（MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件、标准化为LaTeX表示并纠正不一致性。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）语料库，其中Nemotron-CC-Math-4+在质量和规模上都超越了所有现有开源数学数据集。预训练的Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上获得+4.8到+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得+4.6到+14.3的提升，同时改善了MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能。

Conclusion: 这是第一个能够从嘈杂的网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和通用推理方面带来了可衡量的提升，并为开源社区发布了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLMs)由于幻觉问题经常生成误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设才能正确回答。

Method: 首先将问题简化为事实验证任务，然后提出利用外部证据的方法来缓解幻觉。具体包括检索相关证据，生成和验证原子假设，通过指定错误假设来提供可解释的答案。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 利用外部证据和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答质量并提供更好的可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和大视觉语言模型在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解、实体跟踪和多步指令跟随的复杂多轮视觉基础任务时仍面临重大挑战，现有基准无法充分捕捉真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。

Method: 提出MMDR-Bench数据集（包含300个复杂多轮对话场景）和CoLVLM Agent框架，采用记忆-感知-规划-执行的迭代循环机制，无需对底层模型进行大量重新训练。

Result: 在MMDR-Bench上的实验显示，CoLVLM Agent平均人类评估得分4.03，显著超越GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85），在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent的模块化设计和迭代方法能有效处理复杂多模态交互，在扩展对话轮次中保持稳健性能，验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

TL;DR: SemToken是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少分词冗余，在保持模型性能的同时实现2.4倍分词减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余区域的过度分词和上下文连贯性利用不足，特别是在长上下文场景中

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等价的token；然后基于语义密度分配异构分词粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的分词减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向，SemToken可以无缝集成到现代语言模型和注意力加速方法中

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理需要更结构化、符号化且对事实和监管准确性敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM，一个领域专业化的轨迹感知PRM，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用PRMs和强领域基线。下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习提升12.9%，强化学习提升5.2%，测试时性能提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV缓存进行剪枝来减少长上下文推理中的内存和计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，导致效率和准确性平衡受限。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV缓存进行非结构化稀疏剪枝，并在注意力分数计算时动态恢复被剪枝的条目。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，同等序列长度下KV缓存存储减少30%以上，即使80%的激进剪枝比例下性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK是一种有效且鲁棒的KV缓存压缩方法，与现有压缩和量化技术正交兼容，可进一步加速长上下文推理。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨领域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。模拟人类学习的渐进式知识获取过程：先理解概念，再应用于复杂推理。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLM的性能水平。

Conclusion: Selct2Know提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，通过渐进式知识内化策略有效解决了领域特定QA中的挑战，在多个专业领域都表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，解决LLM在多步骤工具调用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从精选库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地用过去成功的轨迹增强经验池。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%。在τ-bench真实世界领域测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER方法通过动态经验池和逐步检索机制，有效解决了LLM在多步骤工具调用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能改进。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中检查表的使用策略，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动生成检查表虽然是有前景的方法，但其有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种模型规模上进行评估，通过成对比较和直接评分实验分析检查表效果，并识别与人工评估相关的检查表项目。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中能改善评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不稳定。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项目也常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，检查表方法在特定场景下具有应用价值但需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少小语言模型词汇相关组件的内存占用达99%，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境中具有计算优势，但词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）由于词汇量大导致内存占用过高，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和计算特性不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：通过卸载嵌入减少内存占用，采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略实现LM头的按需加载。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能几乎没有下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor有效解决了小语言模型部署中的内存瓶颈问题，通过动态词汇选择实现了内存效率与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在英语指令跟随上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。存在的测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和领域特定的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盛四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员的多阶段质量控制过程。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估显示在文化和专业特定任务上的性能差距；(2)指令微调研究进行消融实验隔离原生监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型在领域内外的测试集上都超过了使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业基础的指令数据，以改善大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐效果。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，推动多语言语音技术的发展

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义的前提下，通过翻译替换选定单词来生成代码切换语音

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在可懂度和自然度方面表现优异，在客观和主观指标上与现有数据集相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动代码切换语音技术的发展，实现更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的心理特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLM比人类教师更理想化、极化，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，且推理能力越强的模型越容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型模拟专业角色（如教师）时缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，需要建立专门的评估框架来确保教育AI的伦理和心理对齐。

Method: 提出EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用定向软提示注入集评估教师角色LLM的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLM上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLM表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的个性，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳；推理能力越强的模型越容易受到有害提示注入；模型温度等超参数对风险行为影响有限。

Conclusion: 本文建立了首个评估教师角色LLM伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理安全评估提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 解决检索增强生成(RAG)中外部检索上下文与LLM参数知识冲突时模型无法正确选择可靠知识源的问题

Method: 使用上下文评估器编码压缩记忆token嵌入，通过基于/对抗软提示训练来识别不可靠上下文并引导推理选择更可靠的知识源

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了一个有前景的方向

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Motivation: 自然语言中往往不会明确表述事件的时间上下文，这使得机器理解事件的时间常识变得困难。即使是先进的大语言模型在处理需要时间常识推理的文本生成任务时也存在困难。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到了超过80%的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上表现优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 自动挖掘时间常识能够帮助构建更强大的语言模型，本文提出的方法有效地提升了模型在时间推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，但传统方法需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式

Method: 处理短时固定宽度窗口（约一个音素长度），独立分析，学习所有语言共有的基础声学模式，采用监督和自监督训练

Result: 在多种语言上表现优异，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Motivation: 知识图谱补全模型评估存在挑战，不同数据集和指标（如MRR、Hit@k）的评估结果经常不一致，导致难以进行整体性能比较和模型选择。

Method: 提出基于平均解距离的EDAS元度量方法，将模型在多个数据集和不同评估指标上的表现综合为一个标准化分数（0-1范围）。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等基准数据集上的实验表明，EDAS能有效整合多指标、多数据集性能，提供一致且稳健的模型评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS提供了一个统一、可解释的元度量框架，支持更公平的跨数据集评估和更明智的模型选择决策。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

*Yichi Zhang,Yao Huang,Yifan Wang,Yitong Sun,Chang Liu,Zhe Zhao,Zhengwei Fang,Huanran Chen,Xiao Yang,Xingxing Wei,Hang Su,Yinpeng Dong,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X是一个全面的多模态大语言模型可信度评估基准，包含32个任务和28个数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有模型，揭示了当前模型在真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性和隐私方面的显著漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估方法往往关注狭窄的方面，忽视了多模态性带来的风险，需要构建一个全面的可信度评估框架。

Method: 提出了三维框架：五个可信度维度（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、两种风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）、多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法）。基于此构建了包含32个任务和28个数据集的MultiTrust-X基准。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在局限性，多数方法在改善特定方面的同时会带来意外的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过思维链推理能力帮助模型发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的自适应推测解码框架，通过置信度调节动态调整推测生成长度和验证标准，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了性能提升

Method: 基于信息论的置信度调节推测解码框架，利用drafter输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调节验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用方法，可在不同不确定性条件下实现高效鲁棒的LLM解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大词汇表通过降低token化文本的复杂度来提升语言模型性能，主要受益于高频词的损失降低，而非改善罕见词处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大词汇表对语言模型性能提升的真正来源，当前实践倾向于使用越来越大的词汇表但原因不明

Method: 在固定数据、计算和优化条件下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K进行对照研究，量化token化文本复杂度，分析词级损失分解

Result: 大于24K的词汇表主要通过降低前2500个高频词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，尽管罕见词损失上升；约束嵌入范数会逆转收益

Conclusion: 大词汇表的益处源于降低token化文本复杂度，这为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了原则性指导，并阐明了预训练中的损失动态

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MCR-BENCH基准测试，发现大型音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时存在明显的文本偏向性，经常忽略音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在处理多模态输入方面能力增强，但其在音频和文本信息冲突时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要评估模型如何优先处理不一致的信息。

Method: 开发了首个专门评估音频-文本不一致对处理的综合基准MCR-BENCH，通过广泛的音频理解任务评估，分析模型偏向性，并探索通过监督微调等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向性，在模态不一致时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能大幅下降，即使存在矛盾输入时模型仍表现出持续过度自信。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在训练过程中需要改进模态平衡和开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Conclusion: 该研究为语言翻译领域提供了有效的非对应词汇处理方法，虽然已有部分词汇得到专业渲染，但仍需要继续研究和完善更多非对应词汇的处理方法。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性，需要更有效的状态跟踪和错误纠正机制。

Method: 采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了对话状态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告自动评估方法要么产生粗糙的总体分数，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床基础、可解释性和细粒度指标，限制了在真实临床工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization构建，包含两个关键创新：(1)子分数动态加权，基于实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；(2)多数引导优势缩放，基于子分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有先前的离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床基础、可解释且细粒度的放射学报告评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床工作流程提供了更实用的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销能显著提升客户转化率和满意度，研究表明良好的个性化策略可使收入增长高达40%，但现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，报价生成领域潜力巨大

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调Google的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，采用InfoNCE损失函数在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关报价，通过自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间

Result: 在模拟客户行为和报价接受模式的合成数据集上评估，相比监督微调基线模型，报价接受率提高了17%

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面非常有效，SLM4Offer模型展示了在个性化报价生成任务中的优越性能

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型是否能够有效处理不同用户的主观性浏览行为和偏好，这种行为形成了类似于每个用户自己的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法，采用聚类训练方式，为不同的用户群体训练异质性的参数集，使用页面级别的tokenizer训练小型模型。

Result: 小型LM在浏览语言表现上超过大型预训练或微调LM；HeTLM模型在控制参数数量的情况下超过单一模型；并产生更高的平均性能和更低的方差，提高了用户层面的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 对于主观性行为，小型聚类特定模型比单一大型模型更有效，HeTLM方法能够提高性能平均值并降低方差，实现更好的用户层面对齐。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，使用基于模型训练影响的难度度量（训练数据影响力）进行课程学习，相比传统人工定义的难度度量，能够使语言模型预训练性能提升超过10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，主要是因为人类定义的难度度量与模型实际训练过程中观察到的示例难度不匹配。

Method: 提出使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量标准，根据单个训练示例对模型输出的影响程度来排序训练数据，从影响力小的示例开始训练。

Result: 使用新课程学习方法训练的模型在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的模型性能提升超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练确实有益，但需要使用更符合模型中心视角的难度概念，而不是传统的人类中心难度度量。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM-Bench是首个专门评估小型语言模型(SLMs)的基准测试，从准确性、计算效率和可持续性三个维度对15个SLM在9个NLP任务上进行全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对小型语言模型性能和环境影响系统性评估的基准测试，需要建立标准化评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了SLM-Bench基准测试，在4种硬件配置下评估15个SLM模型，使用23个数据集覆盖14个领域，量化11个正确性、计算和能耗指标。

Result: 评估结果显示不同SLM模型在准确性和能效方面存在显著权衡，部分模型准确性优异，而另一些模型能效表现更好。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，填补了资源效率与实际应用之间的评估空白，提供了开源基准测试流程以促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的大语言模型取得了最佳效果（F1=0.74）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会身份检测数据集主要针对英语、单标签且类别粗糙，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中细粒度社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建包含5536个句子的希伯来语多标签语料库，基于调查数据手动标注12种社会身份，比较多标签/单标签编码器和生成式大语言模型（2B-9B参数）的性能。

Result: 希伯来语调优的大语言模型表现最佳（宏观F1=0.74），应用于政客Facebook帖子和议会演讲分析，发现了受欢迎度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关的身份表达差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: Dream 7B通过简单有效的训练技术实现了扩散语言建模的重大突破，为相关研究提供了Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct两个版本以促进进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政客使用更多


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)作为对政治实体规范性有效性的象征性攻击，缺乏大规模计算分析，需要系统研究其在民主话语中的模式和影响

Method: 构建包含10,410句希伯来语句子的语料库，来自议会演讲、Facebook帖子和新闻媒体；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM；使用DictaLM 2.0模型进行PDD检测和特征分类

Result: 最佳模型在二元PDD检测上F1得分0.74，特征分类macro-F1得分0.67；发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍(17.4% vs 更低)，男性政客比女性使用更多，右翼行为者倾向更强，选举期间和重大政治事件中明显激增

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，研究为政治话语分析提供了新的计算方法和实证发现

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于作为生成器防御有害请求的能力，存在安全不一致性，希望通过对齐模型的判别和生成能力来提升安全性。

Method: 提出SDGO强化学习框架，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自改进来增强生成安全性，无需额外训练数据或外部模型。

Result: SDGO显著提升了模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能，且只需少量判别样本就能进一步增强生成能力。

Conclusion: 通过对齐LLMs的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了更紧密的能力耦合，为模型安全提供了有效的自监督优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Conclusion: 综述生成任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，已开源所有代码、数据和模型。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差严重影响长上下文理解能力，现有方法通过修改架构来缓解但效果有限，需要更有效的方法来减少不同位置间的性能差距。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill知识蒸馏框架，设计了两个专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹用于检索任务，Pos2Distill-R²用于推理任务，利用位置间的固有差异来对抗位置偏差。

Result: 在长上下文检索和推理任务中，所有上下文位置都实现了增强的一致性和显著的性能提升，两个专门系统展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过位置到位置的知识蒸馏有效缓解了位置偏差问题，在保持各自任务优异性能的同时实现了跨任务的相互泛化。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为全球第七大语言（3亿母语者）面临数字资源匮乏问题，词干提取作为关键预处理步骤对于这种低资源、高屈折性语言的分析至关重要，但现有研究存在明显不足。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，全面调查现有的孟加拉语词干提取方法，分析现有研究的局限性和评估方法的不足。

Result: 发现孟加拉语词干提取领域存在显著的研究断层，可复现的实现稀缺，评估指标不够相关，且缺乏对丰富形态和方言多样性的有效处理。

Conclusion: 建议开发更强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，采用更相关的评估指标，并继续深入研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限且设计不足，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，以及图像是否会引入冗余或降低性能。

Method: 构建了包含406,190个样本和8,989,510张图像的EcomMMMU数据集，包含8个核心任务和专门的VSS子集。提出了SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性地利用多张图像进行下游任务。

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，在某些情况下甚至会降低性能，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容进行电商任务方面存在困难。SUMEI方法在实验中表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在电商场景中有效利用视觉内容仍面临挑战，需要更智能的图像选择和使用策略，SUMEI方法为解决这一问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 虽然链式思维推理提升了LLMs的推理能力，但在精确计算任务中仍存在不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其泛化效果和对模型推理行为的改善尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同推理类别，并引入两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估表明，TIR模型在数学和非数学任务中均优于非TIR模型，同时提高了推理效率，表现为PAC和AUC-PCC指标的改善，表明减少了过度思考。

Conclusion: TIR具有领域通用的优势，有潜力提升LLMs在复杂推理任务中的能力，通过整合外部工具实现了更精简高效的推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估真实世界代理能力设定了严格标准，指出了推进当前模型的具体方向，推动通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统发展

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相机或LiDAR的地图匹配方法在烟雾、灰尘等恶劣环境下表现不佳，而磁力计能够探测到其他传感器无法感知的磁场特征，且在这些环境中保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于磁场高阶导数的特征描述符，利用物理信息高斯过程进行高效递归概率推断，获取磁场及其导数信息，实现全局方向不变的地图配准。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，Mag-Match相比基于SIFT的方法表现出色，能够准确实现地图到地图、机器人到地图以及机器人到机器人的变换，无需初始重力对齐。

Conclusion: Mag-Match为恶劣环境下的多会话或多机器人数据集成提供了有效的磁场地图匹配解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究的关键空白，为语言引导机器人代理提供了更全面和现实的基准测试框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Motivation: 现有的学习型灵巧操作策略存在空闲问题，即在某些状态下停止移动，这反映了训练数据的局限性。传统方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能会负面影响策略性能。

Method: 提出PIP方法，检测策略空闲状态并施加扰动，帮助策略逃离问题吸引域，无需额外监督或训练。

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，通过利用空闲状态的可检测性来指导探索和策略改进，在模拟和真实任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Motivation: 以往研究多数重点在最小化空间操纵器系统的动态耦合，而忽视了其潜在优势。本文研究如何利用动态耦合来改善轨迹规划效果。

Method: 采用奇异值分解(SVD)分析动态耦合矩阵，识别主导的耦合行为组件，形成定量指标来表征耦合强度和方向性，并将其整合到轨迹优化框架中。设计滑模控制跟踪控制器来验证优化轨迹的可行性。

Result: 模拟结果表明，在轨迹规划中明确考虑动态耦合可以实现更有效的操作，为自由浮动空间操纵器系统的控制提供新方向。

Conclusion: 利用动态耦合而非避免它，可以提高空间操纵器系统轨迹规划的效率和性能，这为该领域的控制策略带来了新的研究思路。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Result: 实验表明NeRD模拟器在数千个仿真步骤中保持稳定和准确；能够跨任务和环境配置泛化；支持在神经引擎中进行策略学习；可以从真实世界数据微调以缩小仿真与现实之间的差距。

Conclusion: NeRD为机器人动力学模拟提供了一种通用、准确且可泛化的神经解决方案，能够有效处理关节式刚体机器人的复杂接触约束问题，并具有从真实数据学习的能力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.
