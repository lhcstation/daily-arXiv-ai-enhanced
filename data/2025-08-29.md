*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在解释视觉输入时常见的幻觉问题，将其作为对齐问题来处理

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉/非幻觉回答对，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对MLLMs进行精细调整

Result: 在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答数量

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法能够有效提升MLLMs的输出质量，减少幻觉现象

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型引领的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的方法来应对这些挑战

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将图像伪造残差（高频信号）作为显式模态融入潜在空间，保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息，同时提升伪造定位性能

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上达到了相比当前最先进模型进步12%的性能提升，对未见过的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像都表现出强劲的性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的图像生成和知觉能力集成到图像伪造检测框架中，为应对新兴图像编辑技术的挑战提供了更高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索了多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法，通过微调模型从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但其预测结果的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。研究者希望结合MLLMs和定量属性两种方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 通过微调多模态大语言模型，使其能够从皮肤病变图像中预测定量属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究来验证嵌入空间的grounding效果。

Result: 研究提供了证据表明，MLLM嵌入空间可以通过微调来grounding到定量属性中，即模型能够从图像预测这些与病变外观相关的属性值。

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性使用的方法，有望显著提升皮肤疾病诊断AI模型的可解释性，为临床实践应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平准确率，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法中身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真等问题，实现了高质量、长时长的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定以及手部运动建模不佳等问题，导致视频质量下降和音频同步不准确。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频。利用稳定的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制提升手势真实感。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能。消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过解耦姿态与外观、使用稳定的姿态引导和专门的手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动动画中的关键挑战，为高质量长视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了用于360度视频显著性预测的新数据集YT360-EyeTracking和两个基于视觉Transformer的模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，通过整合空间音频信息显著提升了全景视频中的注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球形畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，需要开发新的数据集和模型来准确预测全景视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 构建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360框架（具有球形几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合音频输入的Transformer适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中的观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，音频视觉信息的结合能有效提升显著性预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于视觉-语言模型的解释性人工智能管道，用于在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型的一般行为，发现失败案例并提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而因xAI方法的复杂性，对可解释性关注不够。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，而解释模型在大量数据上的一般行为仍少有研究，这对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势很重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型，提出了一个能够在样本级别和数据集级别解释视觉模型的管道。该管道可以用最小化的努力发现模型的失败案例并获得深度见解。

Result: 该方法能够有效地解释视觉模型的一般行为，发现模型的失败案例，并为视觉模型开发提供了与xAI分析的集成方案。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，该管道提供了一种有效的方法来提高视觉模型的可解释性和可信赖性，从而推动图像分析领域的发展。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD框架结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，将MobileNetV3 Large教师模型知识蒸馏到轻量级CNN学生模型，在农业玫瑰成熟度分类任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为资源受限的农业环境开发轻量级CNN模型，解决农业计算机视觉应用在多样化环境条件下的部署需求。

Method: 提出ATMS-KD框架，结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强技术，从MobileNetV3 Large教师模型向三种配置的轻量级残差CNN学生模型进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，相比直接训练(95-96%)有显著提升。紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提高1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉任务中表现出色，能够有效传递知识并保持低延迟，适用于资源受限的农业环境部署。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言表示和专家知识的微结构质量评估框架，实现零样本分类，无需重新训练模型即可区分合格与缺陷样品


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中先进材料的快速可靠质量评估存在瓶颈，特别是对于非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构，需要将微观结构信息与专家表征知识相结合

Method: 开发定制化混合视觉语言表示(VLRs)，整合深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，编码视觉微结构数据和文本专家评估到共享表示中，使用基于相似性的表示方法和Z-score归一化

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能够区分合格和缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准一致性更好

Conclusion: 该方法通过实现原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，增强了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适应性质量评估策略做出贡献

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型进行自动化辄见空间（PVS）分割，在T2加权MRI上达到了预期的继续性和性能，但在T1加权MRI上表现较差，并未超过nnU-Net的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割PVS耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稀缺跨数据集的渗透性。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5（一种Transformer启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络）用于自动PVS分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用均质的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据集，另一个使用异质的T1加权MRI数据集。

Result: 在T2加权图像上达到了像素级Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），与手动分割的可靠性相当，为文献中最高。在T1加权图像上表现较差（Dice 0.58±0.09）。跨地点验证表现中等。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动PVS分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文机制对于PVS分割并非必需，因为它并未超过nnU-Net的性能。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于反馈的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反向适配到中间注意力机制，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 训练免费、反馈驱动的自适配框架，将基于输出的补丁级对应关系反向适配到中间注意力。设计了关键模块：注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适配剪枝、适配集成，有效反馈输出一致性线索。作为即插即用模块，可无缝集成到多种先进方法中。

Result: 方法在三个骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和四种最先进方法中验证有效，支持多种注意力类型（Q-K、self-self、以及MAE、SAM、DINO增强的Proxy）。在八个基准测试中 consistently 提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

### [12] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉基础处理，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索。研究者希望系统性地分析MLLMs如何处理视觉和文本输入，揭示不同层的功能角色。

Method: 开发了一个探测框架，训练线性分类器从每个层的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别。通过三种控制提示变体进行评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。应用于LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型。

Result: 发现MLLMs具有一致的阶段性结构：早期层执行视觉基础处理，中间层负责词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。虽然整体结构在不同视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料库中保持稳定，但具体层分配会随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，有助于理解MLLMs的内部工作机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言联合嵌入空间可以解耦，将复杂场景的信息分离到不同的概念特定子空间中，以提升下游任务的精确度。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏非负组合的向量组（原子）进行分解，使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索，在TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上均取得定量和定性的改进。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法成功实现了嵌入空间的解耦，为概念级别的图像检索和生成任务提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形化工具包，用于安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，解决PHI泄露等安全风险，支持医生无编程使用和工程师即插即用部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，需要安全可靠的部署方案。

Method: 开发图形用户界面工具包，支持手动模型选择、Hugging Face开源模型集成、Docker编排的隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 评估了5个最先进VLM模型，专家评估涵盖结肠和肾脏病例，共1015次临床医生-模型评分事件，发现存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和不一致的病理术语等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以满足临床需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的跨任务交互对成功至关重要，但充分交互往往导致高计算复杂度，现有方法需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间进行权衡

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个挑战性基准测试上表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上进行了全面实验，证明该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种无需训练的音频指导可视化编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑需求，充分利用音频信息来补充纯文本指导的不足

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性问题

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能不佳，主要由于异质脉冲模式导致的残差膜电位问题

Method: 提出延迟脉冲方法缓解残差膜电位问题，并设计时序依赖IF神经元(tdIF)，使神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上，该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(5时间步内)下达到最先进性能

Conclusion: tdIF方法能够以更低的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相当能耗的同时，实现了高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和模态信息融合不足问题，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构、边缘区域和复杂背景的处理能力。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 提出的MSMVD方法通过多尺度BEV特征生成和特征金字塔融合，有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了一种有效的轻量级解决方案，适合视频会议和社交媒体等实时应用场景

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择和自知识蒸馏，该方法克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医疗图像分类提供了有效的轻量级解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决稀缺病理注释数据的问题，实现了更准确的胎儿脑分割和生物标记物提取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏胎儿脑胶质体叱发育不良(CCD)等稀缺病理的注释数据，限制了深度学习模型的普遍性

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅从健康数据模拟多样的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，在CCD案例中取得显著改善，并保持其他病理的性能。胎胆体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定解剖学先验知识结合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀缺但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

TL;DR: 提出了首个统一框架，能够同时处理手语、唇语和音频等多种输入模态，生成口语文本，在多个任务上达到或超越专门模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，现有视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）各自独立研究，缺乏统一框架来整合这些模态

Method: 设计统一的模态无关架构处理异质输入，探索模态间协同作用（特别是唇部运动作为手语非手动线索的作用）

Result: 在手语翻译、视觉语音识别、自动语音识别和视听语音识别等任务上达到或超越最先进的专门模型性能

Conclusion: 明确将唇部运动建模为独立模态显著提升手语翻译性能，证明了多模态统一框架的有效性和协同优势

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频理解方法存在静态推理或依赖外部视觉语言模型的问题，导致复杂性和性能不佳，缺乏端到端训练。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，逐步选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行推理；引入门控双级奖励系统，结合轨迹级和轮级奖励来优化片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过迭代推理和端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解的能力，为处理长程时间依赖和多个事件提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

TL;DR: DUO是一个针对单目3D目标检测的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义不确定性和几何不确定性，在域偏移场景下提升检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关性，但未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性）问题。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化(DUO)框架：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知法向场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）建立语义-几何互补的双分支机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO是首个专门针对M3OD双重不确定性设计的TTA框架，通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了在域偏移下的检测鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Conclusion: COMETH实现了准确且可扩展的人体运动跟踪，特别适合工业和安全关键应用

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing将指令信息注入视觉编码器选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing通过剪枝实现token级稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制结合因果视觉语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计显著提升了VLA模型的效率和性能，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold

Motivation: 3D点云异常检测研究不足，缺乏像2D那样强大的预训练基础骨干网络，需要有效融合2D和3D模态的优势。

Method: 提出重要性感知集成网络(IAENet)，包含重要性感知融合(IAF)模块动态评估各源贡献度并重新加权异常分数，设计关键损失函数指导IAF优化。

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率。

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D和3D专家知识，提升了工业表面异常检测的实用价值，为工业部署提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit通过重新定义编辑问题为基于参考的文本到图像生成，克服了现有方法的局限性，具有更好的可扩展性和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕捉数据特征，并设置自适应阈值计算置信度进行损失加权自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度加权学习，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了错误累积问题，为持续测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而现有方法缺乏真实场景的地面真值评估

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过回传新视角色彩损失来对相机参数进行细调优化

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR，显著提升了新视角合成质量

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过数据层面的早期融合和迭代精细化策略，可以有效提升无监督3D物体检测的性能，为解决标签涉及问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为更好理解域适应在自然和医学图像中的效果，需要进行系统性评估。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像和8个医学数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有良好可解释性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测对图像退化的鲁棒性，在保持推理效率的同时实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类和恶意内容生成。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的脆弱性并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中负责提取和传输排版信息的专用注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率仅下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 开发了抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型家族，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存机制成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效的解决方案和高质量数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能够有效生成合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位过程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，有效解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法展示了AI辅助乳腺癌症诊断的潜力，代码已公开分享以促进进一步研究

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Motivation: 现有的多模态对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，存在扩展性和成本问题，导致幻觉现象和安全风险

Method: 提出偏见自我判断分数方法，让模型内部生成自我评估指标，无需外部资源，通过改进解码策略和偏好调整过程来实现自主对齐改进

Result: 实验结果显示该方法显著超过传统方法，有效减少了幻觉现象，提升了模型安全性和整体能力

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉-语言模型的多模态对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，具有较高的扩展性和实用价值

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个创新的即插即用框架，通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域来解决3D高斯头像重建中后脑区域质量差的问题，显著提升了头像的完整性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高斯泼溅方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，出现几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：主题特定生成器(SSG)从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视伪图像；自适应空间对齐策略(ASA)使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的大量实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模后脑区域，有效解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为构建完整一致的3D头像提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MobileCLIP的多模态加强训练，通过更好的教师集成和描述生成器来提升模型性能

Method: 1）使用DFN数据集训练更好的CLIP教师集成 2）在多样化高质量图像-描述数据集上微调提升描述生成器 3）探索对比知识萌发中温度调节的重要性

Result: MobileCLIP2-B比MobileCLIP-B在ImageNet-1k上提升2.2%准确率；MobileCLIP2-S4在相同准确率下比SigLIP-SO400M/14小2倍，比DFN ViT-L/14延迟低2.5倍

Conclusion: 新的多模态加强训练方法有效提升了模型性能，MobileCLIP2家族在低延迟和小规模下达到了独占鲜头的零样本准确率

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Motivation: 现有的视频因果问答模型存在高阶推理能力不足、管道不透明、依赖浅层策略等问题，需要更好的可解释性和逻辑一致性。

Method: 提出两阶段模块化架构：因果链提取器(CCE)生成自然语言因果链，因果链驱动回答器(CCDA)基于因果链生成答案；使用大语言模型生成高质量因果链数据；提出CauCo评估指标。

Result: 在三个大规模测试集上超越了最新模型，在可解释性、用户信任和沿射性方面获得显著提升，CCE可作为可重用的因果推理引擎。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架通过明确的因果链表示，有效解决了视频因果问答中的高阶推理挑战，为可解释性AI研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法，在极端风格转换中保持面部身份识别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在涂鸦这种高对比度抽象媒介中，面部特征轻微扭曲会导致身份识别性丧失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 在面部特征一致性方面表现优异，获得最先进的美学和人类偏好评分，在Cruilla Festival现场部署展示了实际创作影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态AI研究主要关注检测合成内容和上下文不一致内容，但忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图识别。为了填补这一空白，需要专门的数据集和方法来识别图像生成的真实意图。

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集（9,576个社交媒体图像-文本对），探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion构建大规模合成训练数据，比较多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 使用图像引导和多模态引导数据训练的模型对真实内容具有更好的泛化能力，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限，表明推断意图的复杂性。

Conclusion: 识别AI生成图像的意图是一个复杂挑战，需要专门的架构和方法。当前方法虽然取得进展，但性能仍有提升空间，凸显了该领域的研究需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化(RDCO)，适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架，成功解决了传统强度基方法忽略解剖区域的问题，在心脏运动估计方面取得了显著改进，并提供了可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销极小，仅需粗略域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Motivation: 现有基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异经过归一化后会产生虚假优势，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench基准为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了开源和闭源模型的优缺点

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20

*Yuxi Hu,Jun Zhang,Kuangyi Chen,Zhe Zhang,Friedrich Fraundorfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-GS是一个用于未见场景新视角合成的通用高斯泼溅框架，通过上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束增强特征学习，无需逐场景优化即可实现高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视角一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确几何结构，限制了渲染质量。

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流程中，引入上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束来改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS达到了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强特征学习实现了无需额外监督的光真实感合成，为通用高斯泼溅提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间推理受限和上下文信息丢失的问题，因为依赖单视角定位。需要消除场景特定训练要求，提高真实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提议，并通过语义过滤进行精炼。采用提议引导的多视角投影策略将候选提议投影到真实场景图像序列上，保持空间关系和上下文细节。使用动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提高了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM通过多视角推理和空间信息保持，显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事车辆识别任务中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比集中遮挡影响更大，并通过微调显著提升了模型抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在缺乏标注数据的防御应用中具有优势，但其在军事环境中面对部分遮挡和信号退化等挑战时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡比例评估CLIP变体的性能，采用标准化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标，比较了Transformer和CNN架构，并进行了线性探测和主干网络微调实验

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP consistently outperforms CNNs; 2) Fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions; 3) Linear-probed models' performance sharply drops at ~35% occlusion; 4) Finetuning the backbone delays performance drop to >60% occlusion

Conclusion: 研究强调了在训练过程中加入遮挡特定增强的重要性，并指出需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实世界军事部署中的应用

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结），而现有视频理解技术主要关注具体可见内容。抽象概念识别是视频理解的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，研究视频抽象概念理解的不同任务和数据集，分析研究社区数十年的经验积累，为基础模型时代重新审视这一挑战提供参考。

Result: 研究发现研究人员长期尝试利用当时可用工具解决抽象概念识别问题，基础模型的进步为解决这一挑战创造了新的机遇。

Conclusion: 借鉴社区数十年经验有助于避免重复造轮子，为基础模型时代重新探索视频抽象概念理解这一重要开放挑战提供指导。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型的准确性已经超越皮肤科医生，但医学实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战。现有的可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，需要更可信、可解释的诊断方法

Method: 全局类激活概率地图评估方法，通过概率化和像素级分析所有类别的激活概率地图，以统一方式可视化诊断过程。同时集成SafeML来检测假诊断和发出警告

Result: 方法在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行了评估

Conclusion: 该方法能够减少误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和病人安全性，为医生和病人提供更可信的AI辅助诊断

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），发现扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合形成新的含义。尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法进行这种组合推理。本文旨在探索生成式扩散分类器是否具有比判别式模型更好的组合泛化能力。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象与属性和关系的能力。通过分析模型在概念绑定和关系推理任务上的表现来比较其组合泛化能力。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都表现显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表征过于相似。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现优于CLIP，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临重大挑战，这表明需要开发更好的关系表征学习方法。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Method: 使用虚拟透视相机参数从Lidar点云初始化surfel，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习位置和旋转的显式等变特征，包含等变卷积编码器、交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和非线性Huber损失

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法表现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决点云配准中对噪声和旋转敏感的问题，在真实点云扫描数据上具有鲁棒性能

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有牙科龋齿检测方法由于对比度变化细微和病变形态多样导致准确率不佳，受牙医临床工作流程启发需要结合整体筛查和局部详细检查

Method: 使用自动牙齿检测建立全局和局部两个互补视图，分别预训练视觉基础模型，通过门控跨视图注意力模块动态融合双视图特征

Result: 在公开数据集和新构建的高精度数据集上均优于现有最先进方法，证明了临床适用性

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练有效提升了牙科龋齿检测的准确性，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FusionCounting框架，将人群计数与可见光-红外图像融合结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失权重策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时实现优越的人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始引入语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在高密度场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了高密度场景下的VIF问题，通过人群计数提供直接量化的人口密度信息，为多模态图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

TL;DR: Dino U-Net是一个基于DINOv3基础模型的编码器-解码器架构，通过专门设计的适配器和保真度感知投影模块，有效利用预训练特征进行医学图像分割，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练的基础模型为医学图像分割提供了强大范式，但如何有效迁移其学习表示以用于精确的临床应用仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构，使用冻结的DINOv3主干作为编码器，通过专门适配器融合语义特征和空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持特征质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，且随着主干模型规模增大（最高达70亿参数），分割精度持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为推进医学图像分割精度提供了一种高效且参数有效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Motivation: 视频扩散生成领域在采样效率方面存在瓶颈，现有图像加速方法无法建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗平衡机制在高斯噪声空间中进行稳定的单步对抗训练；对于条件生成还提出条件对抗一致性方法。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速）。

Conclusion: POSE框架成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算延迟。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，显著提升效率同时保持强性能表现

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器，通过分层泛化测试和多模态大语言模型的模式感知推理来解决深度伪造检测在真实场景中的泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake数据集模拟真实世界挑战；提出Veritas MLLM检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）和两阶段训练流程

Result: 先前检测器在跨模型场景中表现良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型深度伪造技术，通过局部区域或时间段的微妙修改来创建部分伪造视频，比传统深度伪造更具欺骗性且难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法主要针对完全合成的内容，而部分伪造视频将真实元素与局部修改无缝融合，现有检测能力存在严重不足，需要专门的数据集和方法来应对这种新型威胁。

Method: 提出了FakePartsBench基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。通过用户研究和现有检测模型的性能测试来验证部分伪造的欺骗性。

Result: 用户研究表明FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造降低30%以上，最先进的检测模型也出现类似的性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在应对部分视频操作方面的紧迫漏洞，并为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要的资源和基准数据集。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点踪踪器，使用4台摄像机即可进行精确的3D点踪踪，充分解决了单目踪踪深度歧义和遮挡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目踪踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多相机方法需要20台以上摄像机且需每序列优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D踪踪方案

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关和transformer基础的更新机制来预测3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位数轨迹误差，能够良好适应1-8个视角的各种摄像机配置

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D踪踪研究设定了新标准，提供了一种可用于实际应用的实用工具，并开源了踪踪器和数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖任务特定的监督微调，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要一种统一的框架来处理多任务生成问题

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的监督微调

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上均优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架通过单一奖励模型有效提升了多任务生成能力，证明了在多样化任务和数据背景下统一强化学习方法的有效性

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

TL;DR: Dress&Dance是一个视频扩散框架，能够生成高质量5秒24FPS的虚拟试穿视频，支持单张用户图像输入，可处理多种服装类型，并通过新颖的CondNet条件网络统一多模态输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿解决方案在视频生成质量和运动保真度方面存在不足，需要开发一个能够生成高质量试穿视频并保持服装注册和运动一致性的框架。

Method: 采用视频扩散框架，引入CondNet条件网络利用注意力机制统一文本、图像和视频等多模态输入，通过多阶段渐进方式在异质训练数据（有限视频数据和大量图像数据）上进行训练。

Result: 该框架能够生成1152x720分辨率的高质量试穿视频，在服装注册和运动保真度方面优于现有的开源和商业解决方案。

Conclusion: Dress&Dance提供了一个高质量且灵活的虚拟试穿体验，通过创新的CondNet架构和多模态输入处理，显著提升了虚拟试穿视频的生成质量。

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions
and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024擦除不可见水印挑战的获胜解决方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种水印移除方法，实现了95.7%的近乎完美水印移除率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性尚不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对抗条件下的稳健性。

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过空间或频域伪影聚类图像，应用扩散模型配合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 实证评估显示该方法成功实现近乎完美的水印移除（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该研究希望这些攻击方法能够启发开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型在处理非英语文本时表现出与英语模型类似的社会偏见，需要系统性地研究如何将这些偏见的评估和缓解方法扩展到多语言环境中，以促进更具包容性和文化适宜性的NLP技术发展。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析现有研究在语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术选择等方面的特点，识别主导方法论设计选择中的差距。

Result: 研究发现当前多语言偏见研究存在语言偏好性（偏向某些语言）、多语言缓解实验稀缺等问题，同时整理了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准测试中的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了未来研究方向，旨在加强多语言偏见文献的包容性、跨文化适宜性，并与最先进的NLP进展保持同步。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用语言模型自动生成形态评估的多项选择题，通过结构化提示策略和微调中等模型来降低成本和提高一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低手动测试开发的成本和不一致性，为K-12教育提供实用的语言评估项目开发和验证方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5 175B)；评估7种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链等。使用自动化指标和专家评分进行评估，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略（特别是思维链和顺序设计组合）显著改善了Gemma的输出效果。Gemma通常比GPT-3.5的零样本响应产生更多构造对齐和教学适当的项目，提示设计在中等规模模型性能中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可以在有限数据条件下增强中等规模模型的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟可以确保与评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供了实用且可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Method: 通过将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同模拟功能模块(FMU)，开发轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战。

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了该集成方法的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为异构模拟环境之间提供了无缝的标准化集成方式，推动了跨领域协同模拟的发展。

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO方法，通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决了小型语言模型在强化学习训练中奖励稀疏和不稳定的问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习中面临奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，难以实现代理式RAG行为。

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示的冷启动初始化和策略优化过程中的持续教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，使代理式RAG在计算资源受限环境中变得可行。

Conclusion: DGPO方法有效解决了小型语言模型在强化学习训练中的困难，通过引入ARC细粒度评估指标，证明了该方法在资源受限环境中的可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种测试方法，将政府发布的AI伦理指南转化为具体的违规测试问题，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM的合规性，并包含越狱诊断功能来识别潜在的安全绕过场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其生成有害内容的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏可操作的测试方法，需要将指南转化为具体的测试问题来验证LLM合规性。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的问题来测试LLM响应，当响应直接违反指南时报告不一致性。GUARD-JD集成越狱诊断概念，创建场景来诱发不道德或违规响应，识别可能绕过内置安全机制的情况。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o和Claude-3.7）上进行了实证验证，测试了三个政府发布指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可将越狱诊断迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种有效的方法来将高层级伦理指南转化为可操作的测试问题，能够系统评估LLM的合规性并识别潜在安全漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理来增强大语言模型的长文本理解能力，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临的内存限制、复杂任务处理困难、缺乏透明度和容易产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 集成三个关键组件：策略性文本分块的摘要提取、构建有向无环图消除冗余、使用蒙特卡洛树搜索导航复杂推理路径。

Result: 在ROUGE和F1指标上持续优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖解决方案，提高了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Method: 两阶段后训练框架：1）在拒绝采样的NPH图论实例上进行长思维链有监督微调，提升推理深度；2）使用细粒度奖励设计进行强化学习，提高推理效率。

Result: 标志模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编码、STEM和逻辑领域展现强大泛化能力，在NPH图论问题上的准确性和推理效率都超过QwQ-32B。

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种有效且可扩展的资源，为LLM的长思维链推理能力培养开启了新方向，提供了替代人工精选数据集的可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性但引起人格偏移，GPT模型对问题顺序鲁棒而Gemini和Llama敏感，GPT响应源于内在人格特质和先前交互，其他模型更依赖先前交互

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高响应一致性并更好符合人类判断，为LLM行为评估提供了更真实的框架

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [107] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增对应错误答案。错误推理路径通常更长，说明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证答案置信度提升，需要预测推理步骤的有效性以提前停止或修剪无效步骤。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的预期负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，提高推理效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和语料库，用于评估和改进LLM在牙科专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学LLM在牙科等专业领域的评估资源不足，需要专门针对牙科领域的基准测试来推动相关模型发展。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个双语问答问题）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的牙科语料库），评估14个LLM并测试领域适应效果。

Result: 发现不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距，领域适应显著提升模型表现，特别是在知识密集和术语相关任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信有效的医疗领域LLM至关重要，DentalBench为牙科领域LLM发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的结构化关系表示和语义丰富化处理

Method: 提出包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块的模型无关框架，通过知识图谱增强查询的上下文表示

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上实现mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%，在多跳问答等挑战性任务中表现优异

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的查询丰富化有效提升了RAG系统的检索效果，且具有模型无关性和可扩展性

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Result: 证明了该基准在评估模型在民航维修领域性能方面的有效性，并开源了评估基准和代码。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLM评估在专业领域的空白，为推动民航维修智能化解决方案的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

Motivation: 开发一个能够基于历史案例相似性来搜索实践工作标题的系统，帮助用户快速找到相关的实践工作

Method: 使用案例推理(CBR)技术，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，采用余弦相似度算法计算标题之间的相似性值

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统能够准确搜索标题和关键词，第二阶段测试获得相同数量的匹配标题和最高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的结合在案例推理中表现良好，为实践工作搜索提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种深度学习框架，整合多模态电子健康记录（结构化和自由文本）来预测ICU死亡率和资源利用，在三个临床任务上均优于现有方法，且对数据损坏具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化EHR，忽略了自由文本中的临床洞察力，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR的预测模型来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医学提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并在三个临床任务上与现有领先方法进行比较评估。

Result: 在三个临床任务上：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提升1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE提升0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%，且在不同损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的成功，对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

Method: 创建ConspirED数据集，包含从在线阴谋论文章中提取的多句子摘录，使用CONSPIR认知框架进行标注，并开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征和评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现大型语言模型在处理阴谋论内容时会产生与输入推理模式相似的输出，即使能够成功反驳类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED数据集为识别阴谋论认知特征和评估AI模型对阴谋论输入的脆弱性提供了重要工具，揭示了当前AI模型在处理阴谋论内容时的局限性。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定和文化偏见、命名实体复制漏洞等问题，需要更通用的领域和文化中性基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在关键缺陷，需要改进基准设计以更好地反映现实翻译挑战。

Method: 通过人工评估四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析源文本的领域特定性和文化偏见，测试简单启发式方法（如复制命名实体）对BLEU分数的影响。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源文本过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单启发式方法可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好。

Conclusion: 需要构建使用领域通用和文化中性源文本、减少命名实体依赖的多语言MT基准，以更准确地评估真实世界的翻译能力。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Conclusion: SciTopic通过LLM增强的方法有效提升了科学主题发现性能，使研究人员能够获得更深入和快速的研究洞察。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

### [120] [Adaptive Federated Distillation for Multi-Domain Non-IID Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20557)
*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对多领域非IID数据的自适应联邦蒸馏框架(AdaFD)，建立了包含语言领域多样性的综合基准测试，在真实环境中提升了联邦学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，设计多领域非IID场景基准测试，支持同构和异构设置，通过蒸馏技术处理客户端数据分布差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够有效捕捉本地客户端的多样性，在性能上优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习在多领域非IID环境中的评估提供了统一基准，AdaFD框架在处理语言领域多样性方面表现出色，推动了隐私保护联邦学习在实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，提出的轻量级框架在性能和效率方面都表现出色，为实时网络搜索摘要提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

TL;DR: 提出Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS)框架，通过采样多样化知识组合来增强多跳问答的数据多样性，解决数据稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，现有方法侧重简单问题生成而忽略知识整合，需要提升知识组合的多样性。

Method: 将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关知识，推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Result: KCS在知识组合选择准确率上提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上通过数据增强获得改进。

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答中知识组合的多样性和准确性，为数据稀疏性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了图语言模型现有评测标准的不足，并创建了新的CLEGR评测框架来量化多模态推理能力，发现当前GLM模型在结构化推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图语言模型评测标准主要重用节点分类数据集，无法有效评估多模态推理能力，需要创建专门的评测框架。

Method: 提出CLEGR评测标准，通过综合图语言推理的合成图生成流水线，设计需要结构和语义联合推理的问题，对各种GLM架构进行详细评测。

Result: 发现软提示LLM基线模型与集成GNN的GLM表现相似，GLM在结构化推理任务中出现显著性能下降，对当前模型架构的必要性提出疑问。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图语言推理能力上存在显著局限性，CLEGR标准为进一步推进多模态推理研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，设计给予式方法来注释ASR识别结果中的实体错误并替换为正确实体

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上验证，该方法能够显著提高实体准确性

Conclusion: 该新题纠正方法在处理词形差异场景下有效，将开源相关测试集和训练数据

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型既提升了文本隐写术的质量，也强调了水印技术作为防止恶意使用的重要性。分词不一致性会影响系统的稳健性，需要解决。

Method: 识别了导致分词不一致的问题token的两大特征：低频率和临时性。针对隐写术提出了步进验证方法，针对水印技术提出了后处理回滚方法。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)在隐写术中，直接解决分词不一致问题比传统消除歧义方法更好地提升了流畅性、零感知性和反隐写分析能力；(2)在水印技术中，解决分词不一致问题提高了检测能力和对攻击的稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过分析分词不一致问题的根本特征，本研究提出的专门解决方案能够有效提升文本隐写术和水印技术的性能，为大语言模型的安全应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型，仅用一周时间训练就达到80.6%的AIME24和69.8%的AIME25通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维（CoT）方法存在局限性，需要开发能够自主思考、使用编程工具并基于执行反馈进行验证和优化的智能推理模型，以在复杂问题解决中实现更高级的认知行为。

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：1）非推理监督微调；2）多阶段强化学习；3）GRPO-RoC算法配合重采样策略处理代码环境噪声；4）高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐量Python代码执行。

Result: 模型在仅510个RL步骤和一周训练时间内，在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越671B参数的DeepSeek-R1模型，且响应更短。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在数学推理任务中的有效性，不仅实现了前沿性能，还展现出在一致性、科学推理和工具使用任务上的强大泛化能力，为高效训练大型推理模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决本地差分隐私下文本隐私保护的挑战，传统方法在低ε值时效果不佳，需要新的方法来平衡隐私和实用性

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，使用语义三元组进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，采用分治策略，并结合LLM进行后处理以提高文本连贯性

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯的文本，实现了隐私保护和实用性的更好平衡

Conclusion: 研究强调了文本连贯性在合理ε水平下实现平衡隐私化输出的重要性，分治范式结合LLM后处理是有效的解决方案

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上实现了最优性能：内部数据集F1-macro提升1.10个百分点，跨数据集提升20.35个百分点

Conclusion: 通用嵌入模型通过简单细调即可在隐式敌意言语检测中获得突出性能，无需复杂的外部知识补充

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的心理治疗对话在心理健康NLP中广泛应用，需要验证这些合成对话是否能捕捉真实治疗中的细腻情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析情感轨迹，比较真实CBT会话（来自公开视频转录）和合成对话（CACTUS数据集）在效价、唤醒度和支配度三个维度上的差异。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅结构连贯，但在情感特性上与真实对话存在显著差异：真实会话情感变异性更大、情感语言更丰富、反应和调节模式更真实，特别是客户角色的情感轨迹相似度很低。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在情感保真度局限，强调了心理健康应用中情感真实性的重要性，并为此推出了RealCBT真实数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

Motivation: 现有安全机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全对齐的方法。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，从小型有害/无害指令对计算安全方向。

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等基准测试中保持模型实用性，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类的性能并提升整体学习能力，在事件时序关系提取任务中表现出色

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的框架来构建评估基准，挑战RAG系统整合多源信息并生成长篇回答的能力，创建了两个新基准MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强系统通常在单源或短答案场景下评估，但现实应用需要整合分散在多源中的信息，没有单一源足以回答用户问题。

Method: 开发可扩展框架构建评估基准，创建MSRS-Story（叙事合成）和MSRS-Meet（摘要）两个基准，使用稀疏和稠密检索器结合前沿LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 生成质量高度依赖检索效果，不同任务间差异很大；即使在理想检索设置下，多源合成仍具挑战性；推理模型在此步骤显著优于标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合对RAG系统提出了重要挑战，需要检索组件识别多种相关性信号，生成组件能够跨多源连接和综合信息，推理模型在此类任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对多语言任务的影响研究不足，特别是在机器翻译领域需要系统评估不同量化方法对多种语言的影响

Method: 使用5个从1.7B到70B参数的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术

Result: 4位量化对高资源语言和大模型影响小，但低资源语言在2位量化时质量显著下降；GGUF方法在2位精度下表现最一致；语言匹配的校准主要在低比特场景下有益

Conclusion: 量化算法选择和模型大小共同决定鲁棒性，研究结果为在量化约束下部署多语言LLM机器翻译提供了实用指导，特别是在低资源设置中

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 当前语音到语音大语言模型的评估存在根本性挑战，传统级联方法忽视声学特征，缺乏端到端的综合评估方法。

Method: 提出SageLM模型，联合评估语义和声学维度；使用理性监督增强可解释性；构建SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集；采用两阶段训练范式解决语音偏好数据稀缺问题。

Result: SageLM与人类评估者达成82.79%的一致率，分别比级联基线和SLM基线至少高出7.42%和26.20%。

Conclusion: SageLM为语音到语音LLM提供了有效的端到端评估框架，在语义和声学维度上都表现出优越性能，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话环境中存在推理不一致、难以遵守领域特定政策、长期工具调用中信息提取困难等问题，需要改进

Method: 提出IRMA（Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent）框架，自动重构用户查询，增加相关领域规则和工具建议，帮助工具调用代理更好地聚焦

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上分别比ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection方法高出16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性，有效解决了LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习示例选择策略忽视了结构对齐，导致语义解析任务中的性能不佳和治理化能力差。

Result: 在四个语义解析任务的基准测试中，方法一赴超越现有基线，适用于多个最新大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、治理化能力和性能之间实现了良好平衡，且无需大规模调整可集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导，建立跨领域评估指标，自动生成多样化评估数据，开发了6个领域的328个评估环境。

Result: 实验测试22种不同类型的大语言模型，发现DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为主动对话能力的系统评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法全面应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: 内部机制：使用轻量级数据集训练干净模型，然后与后门模型合并以稀释后门影响；外部机制：在提示中加入良性相关证据来分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM上的实验表明，LETHE优于8个先进防御基线，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用

Conclusion: LETHE是一种成本效益高且鲁棒的后门防御方法，能够有效应对各种复杂的后门攻击场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子级关系抽取，在多个数据集上优于现有方法，但发现在大规模数据集Wikidata上性能较低，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子级关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在大规模数据集上性能不佳，需要探索更有效的模型来处理标签噪声和提升表示能力。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子级关系抽取，通过动态路由来改善实体关系的表示和匹配。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上取得了state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力也是句子级关系抽取的一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面优于传统模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

Conclusion: 神经符号架构为提供可靠、经济可行的税务援助提供了有前景的解决方案，有助于提高公平获取税务服务的可及性。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的机器人操作提供了模块化、高效且有效的碰撞避免解决方案，已集成到协作机器人应用中证明其实用性

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Conclusion: SPGrasp有效解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，实现了低延迟高精度的实时动态抓取合成。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in

Motivation: 剪切信息在动态物体交互任务中至关重要，但由于剪切动力学的复杂性，在模拟中准确建模剪切一直是个挑战。

Method: 提出shPix2pix（剪切条件U-Net GAN），将无剪切信息的模拟触觉图像与剪切编码向量结合，生成包含剪切变形的真实触觉图像。使用低成本桌面机械臂和视觉触觉传感器进行触觉跟踪和协作举升任务验证。

Conclusion: 验证了使用刚体模拟器进行sim-to-real剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人学的模拟开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合XCoM/LIPM步态模板与轻量级残差规划器，使双足机器人能够可靠地通过0.2米宽的窄梁。


<details>

Motivation: 解决双足机器人在窄梁上行走的挑战，包括稀疏的安全关键接触点和纯学习策略的脆弱性。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段在平地上训练跟踪器跟随脚步目标；第二阶段在梁上训练高层规划器预测摆动脚的残差，优化模板步态以确保安全精确的落脚。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上成功通过0.2米宽、3米长的梁，残差优化方法在成功率、中心线跟随和安全裕度方面均优于模板方法和整体基线。

Conclusion: 该结构化脚步接口实现了透明的分析和低摩擦的仿真到现实迁移，为双足机器人的窄梁行走提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the
development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a
survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task
allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement
learning (RL). The advantages and disadvantages of the surveyed methods are
analysed thoroughly. We also propose and discuss in detail various future
research directions that shed light on how to improve existing algorithms or

machines in real-world applications. The findings indicate that CI and deep RL
methods provide viable approaches to addressing complex task allocation
problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep
RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is
envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a
comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to
autonomous machines. It also highlights underexplored areas, identifies
emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future
research within this domain.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够实现基于人类意图的灵活任务转换，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs框架为人机协作提供了更智能、更流畅的安全保证方案，通过不确定性感知实现了安全性与效率的更好平衡

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual
reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive
fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced
human-machine interaction applications.

Conclusion: PEWM模型利用视频模型的时空视觉先验知和VLM的语义认知能力，桥接了细粒度物理互动与高级推理之间的间隔，为可扩展、可解释的通用体验智能平台探索了新路径。

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 集成多种环境数据和强化遗传编程能显著提升路径规划算法的计算效率和解决方案质量

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了语义感知和空间推理，为机器人在复杂非结构化环境中的物体搜索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

Method: 使用大规模训练的基于注意力的模型，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置在不同偏航和俯仰方向上的定位精度分布，并将这些精度分布整合到路径规划器中。

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划任务中都取得了最先进的性能，能够有效提升定位鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其能够广泛应用于各种机器人导航和检测任务，通过主动选择信息丰富的视角来显著提升定位可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: RME框架能够在无外部传感系统的情况下实现快速、安全的动力学模型适应，为机器人在物理交互过程中应对动态变化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.
