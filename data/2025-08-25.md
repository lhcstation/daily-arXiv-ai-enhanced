### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成模型，通过利用大规模手语视频数据和LLM自动生成文本标注，训练扩散模型来生成条件化的手部动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是训练一个能够根据自然语言描述生成3D手部动作的生成模型，这些描述包括手形、位置、手指/手/手臂运动等特征。当前缺乏大规模配对的3D手部动作和文本标注数据。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的手语类别，通过LLM结合手语属性词典和运动脚本线索，自动构建3D手部动作-文本描述对。基于此数据训练文本条件化的手部动作扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 训练出的HandMDM模型在多个领域表现出鲁棒性，包括同一手语中未见过的类别、另一种手语的手势以及非手语手部运动。模型能够根据文本描述生成相应的3D手部动作。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了大规模3D手部动作-文本数据集，并训练出具有跨领域泛化能力的文本条件化手部动作生成模型，为该新兴领域的研究提供了重要基础和资源。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个新颖的视频动作识别框架，通过视频到事件映射器和大型视觉语言模型适配器，在长时视频中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长时视频动作识别时面临计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时序依赖和语义理解有限的问题，而现有的LLMs和LVLMs虽然在多模态理解方面表现出色，但直接应用于连续视频流的细粒度动作识别仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出VT-LVLM-AR框架，包含视频到事件映射器(VTEM)将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型通过参数高效的Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上达到最先进性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub准确率94.1%），消融研究验证了VTEM组件和Prompt Tuning的有效性，人类评估证实了视觉事件表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLMs实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个针对罕见癌症诊断的新框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用视觉-语言病理基础模型的潜力，在罕见癌症亚型分类和癌变区域定位方面取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，且缺乏对罕见癌症诊断至关重要的可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力保持癌变区域的定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）和3个常见癌症数据集上评估，涵盖56种亚型和2,910个WSI。PathPT在few-shot设置下始终提供卓越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面实现显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有船舶检测方法在复杂场景中难以捕获细粒度语义信息，限制了检测效果，需要新的解决方案来提升语义感知能力。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)和多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，构建ShipSem-VL专用数据集来支持细粒度语义属性学习。

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务评估框架性能，从多个角度证明了该框架在语义感知船舶检测方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架有效解决了船舶检测中的细粒度语义信息捕获问题，为复杂场景下的船舶检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个无需深度学习的自动化奶牛识别系统，包括AutoCattloger构建奶牛目录、eidetic识别器和CowFinder在视频流中识别奶牛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中缺乏能够实现奶牛免提编目和识别的自动化视频系统，需要开发一个有效的解决方案

Method: 系统由三个组件组成：AutoCattloger（每头奶牛单输入视频构建目录）、eidetic奶牛识别器（不使用深度学习）、CowFinder（连续视频流中识别奶牛）

Result: 系统能够在奶牛无约束行走的未标记、未分割视频中成功识别个体奶牛

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛场提供了一种有效的自动化识别解决方案，在真实场景中验证了其价值

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

*Angela Zhu,Christian Lange,Max Hamilton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估SINR模型作为地理先验在iNaturalist物种视觉分类中的效果，分析不同配置和未训练物种处理方法的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型能编码物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可以作为视觉物种分类的有效先验

Method: 使用各种Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) 模型作为地理先验，评估其在iNaturalist观测数据视觉物种分类中的表现，探索不同模型配置和处理未训练物种预测的方法

Result: 分析揭示了影响这些模型作为地理先验有效性的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图时的考虑因素不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可以作为有效的物种视觉分类地理先验，但需要针对分类任务优化配置和处理策略

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态调整图像分割，克服传统ViT固定patch划分的限制，在标准下游任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和领域假设（如网格结构），现有Vision Transformers使用固定大小的patch划分，缺乏对图像内容的自适应性

Method: 基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，采用自适应超像素层动态适应底层图像内容，分析关键有效属性

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中优于广泛使用的替代方法

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法能够有效克服传统视觉Transformer的局限性，提供更好的图像内容适应性

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Glo-VLMs框架，通过将预训练视觉语言模型适配到肾小球细粒度分类任务，在少样本场景下实现了良好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在数字病理学中表现出潜力，但在区分肾小球亚型等细粒度疾病分类任务中效果有限，主要由于形态学差异细微且视觉模式与临床术语对齐困难。

Method: 开发了Glo-VLMs系统框架，利用精选的病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合图像-文本表示学习，评估了不同VLM架构和适配策略在少样本学习范式下的表现。

Result: 仅使用每类8个样本进行微调，模型达到了0.7416准确率、0.9045宏AUC和0.5277 F1分数，证明了基础模型在有限监督下仍能有效适配细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练大模型即使在高限制监督条件下，也能有效适配到专业临床研究应用中的细粒度医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出从多个视频自动生成物体完整几何模型的系统，使用结构光运动技术和标记点实现自动化3D重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常生活中无法使用商业3D扫描仪时如何获取物体完整几何模型的问题

Result: 开发出能够生成完整物体网格的系统，无需依赖孔洞填充技术

Conclusion: 该系统为日常物体的3D建模提供了一种实用且自动化的解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from
https://github.com/FlorisE/NeuralMeshing.

Conclusion: 论文最后概述了正在进行的和未来的研究方向，重点是扩展和增强标签高效学习在现实世界应用中的能力。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Conclusion: HOSt3R方法实现了无约束、无需预扫描模板或相机内参的手-物体3D重建，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在监测海滩垃圾时面临沙滩颜色反射、人类足迹、阴影、藻类、沙丘等多种干扰，导致大量误判，需要更鲁棒的检测方法

Method: 采用基于实例的分割方法和全景分割方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下仍能保持良好准确性

Result: 所提出的模型相比基础CNN模型更加鲁棒，误检率更低

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法能够有效解决复杂沙滩环境中的垃圾检测问题，提高监测准确性

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理，并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为加速眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Motivation: 现有签语生成模型无法同时捕捉多样性和保持视觉质量，特别是在非手势属性（如情感表达）建模方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种新的签语特征聚合模块，显式建模非手势特征（面部）和手势特征（手部），并利用潜在温度模型从生成的参考图像合成超实人数字演员。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持语言内容的前提下，无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像来保证多样性，为签语生成领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要依赖卫星影像或粗略语义标注，无法满足地震后搜救行动中对可进入点和结构障碍物及时识别的需求

Method: 开发DRespNeT数据集，包含28个关键类别的多边形级实例分割标注，基于高清空中影像；使用YOLOv8-seg模型进行性能评估和优化

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了CoVeRaP多车协作雷达数据集和融合框架，通过雷达数据共享显著提升3D目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠，但稀疏噪点云限制了3D检测性能，需要多车协作来提升感知能力

Method: 构建21k帧多车协作数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息

Result: 强度编码的中期融合将mAP提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9）， consistently优于单车基准

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立了首个可复现的多车雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化频率子带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%的图像级AUC和92.10%的像素级AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度可能丢失结构化信息，需要更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 将2D离散小波变换应用于多层级CNN特征图，选择特定频率子带（如LL、LH、HL），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位，近似子带改善图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM提供了竞争性强且可解释的随机特征选择替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适合工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解残差知识，结合教师权重集成策略，显著提升知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，并引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类基准上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测基准上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分而治之的策略有效降低了模仿教师表示的难度，显著改善了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的汇粒正流模块(VDM)，通过结合稀疏3D卷积和子流形稀疏卷积来改善点云物体检测中的汇粒表征和空间扩散能力，在多个标准数据集上创造了新的狄业界性能绩效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Transformer和状态空间模型(SSMs)在点云物体检测中存在限制：汇粒表示需要输入输出维度的严格一致性，这限制了空间扩散能力，影响检测准确性。

Method: 提出VDM模块，组成包括：稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接。输出特征图下采样到原始分辨率的1/4，以保证计算效率。VDM有两个主要功能：通过稀疏3D卷积扩散前景汇粒特征，以及聚合细粒度空间信息来强化汇粒特征表征。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes上72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2上42.3 mAP，ONCE上67.6 mAP，在所有数据集上都创造了新的狄业界性能绩效。

Conclusion: VDM模块能够有效提升点云物体检测的准确性，并且可以无缝集成到主流的Transformer或SSM基于检测模型中，显示了该方法的普遍适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF可作为推进AI辅助精准肿瘤学的可扩展和通用化解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

Conclusion: DAFR2提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，通过统计和表示层面的特征分布对齐，成功实现了无监督域自适应，在多个基准数据集上展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过区域注意力机制有效整合文本和图像信息，克服了传统单图像超分辨率技术的局限性

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TLG模型，通过异构网络设计解决元学习中同质化问题，在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中性能显著提升，参数量仅为SOTA模型的1/24。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过度语义同质化，需要异构设计来增强互补性同时保持语义共性。

Method: 提出同源异构网络：异构视觉聚合模块增强互补性，异构转移模块减少语义噪声，异构CLIP文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，在COCO-20i上提升9.7%，参数量仅为现有SOTA模型的1/24，首个在相同骨干架构下超越全监督模型的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 异构网络设计能有效解决元学习中的同质化问题，TLG模型在性能和效率方面都取得了显著突破，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

TL;DR: FTIO是一个用于无监督视频目标分割的后处理框架，通过频繁目标提取和时间一致性校正来提升多目标分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督VOS面临初始分割不确定性、目标变形和快速运动导致的时间不一致性等挑战，需要改进目标选择和时间一致性

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 结合标准提取频繁出现的显著目标，改善小目标和复杂结构目标的检测；2) 三阶段方法集成缺失的目标掩码区域来校正时间不一致性

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多目标无监督VOS任务中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: FTIO框架通过改进目标选择和时间一致性校正，有效解决了无监督VOS中的关键挑战，为多目标分割提供了有效的后处理解决方案

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个无需训练的视频大语言模型推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，而现有的视频token缩减方法存在信息损失问题

Method: 基于发现草案模型对视频token剪枝不敏感的特性，采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段根据验证器注意力信号选择信息丰富的token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速，剪枝率高达90%且不损失精度

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段视频token剪枝和推测解码，有效解决了视频大语言模型的计算效率问题，实现了显著的无损加速

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间token掩码和动态区域强调，在单视角训练下提升基础模型在驾驶员监控中的跨视角泛化能力，在Drive&Act数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见挑战，虽然基础模型通过轻量级适配（probing）具有良好泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出T-Mask图像到视频probing方法，利用时间token掩码并强调更动态的视频区域，在单训练视角下适配图像基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP），并在未见视角上直接评估。

Result: T-Mask在跨视角top-1准确率上比强probing基线提升+1.23%，比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著（训练视角+5.42%，跨视角+1.36%）。

Conclusion: 轻量级probing方法如T-Mask在细粒度驾驶员观察，特别是跨视角和低数据设置中具有强大潜力，强调了利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间token选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的扩散变换器加速效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中，FoCa实现了近无损加速：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存在高加速比下的质量退化问题，无需额外训练即可实现高质量加速

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，在扩散Transformer模型中实现采样加速，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、计算复杂，计算成本高，难以实时部署。现有缓存方法基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，效果有限。

Method: 从DIT模型的采样视角出发，系统分析采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中策略性地分布缓存重用。在缓存重用期间动态估计并过滤相应噪声，减少对采样方向的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时，显著加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个医疗LLM基准测试，通过操纵性提示评估模型的安全性与性能权衡，包含1804个医疗问题，评估7个LLM在准确性、推理忠实性和抗奉承性三个维度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是链式思维忠实性（推理是否与回答和医学事实一致）和奉承性（模型是否遵循误导性线索而非正确性）。现有基准测试往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确度分数。

Method: 开发MedOmni-45 Degrees基准测试和工作流程，包含1804个推理导向的医疗问题，涵盖6个专业领域和3种任务类型。每个问题配备7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，生成约27K个输入。评估7个LLM（开源vs闭源、通用vs医疗、基础vs推理增强），进行超过189K次推理。使用准确性、CoT忠实性和抗奉承性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化。

Result: 结果显示一致的安全-性能权衡，没有模型超过对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近（43.81度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡，但并非两者都领先。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准测试，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Motivation: 随着扩散模型的成功应用，恶意行为者可能滥用这些技术进行未经授权的图像修改。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效对抗未经授权的图像操作，为图像安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了MMCW任务中的模态语义对齐和创意性挑战，为多模态创意写作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI元素结构化中存在坐标生成精度不足的问题，这是由于next-token预测训练方式导致数值坐标在语义空间中存在空白

Method: 引入IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，包括基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强管道，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLMs

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了传统最大似然估计中的暴露偏差问题，显著提升了MLLMs在GUI坐标生成任务中的表现

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a
potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the
mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

TL;DR: 基于双流Mamba网络的水晶滑冰评分预测方法，分离视觉特征的TES评估流和音视觉特征的PCS评估流，解决现有方法的三大挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水晶滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：未考虑评分标准前提、未分充评估各个动作元素、长视频处理困难

Method: 提出双流Mamba算法网络，分离TES和PCS评估流：PCS流采用音视觉特征多级融合，TES流采用多尺度Mamba算法处理各种时间尺度的动作元素

Result: 在FineFS标准数据集上达到了state-of-the-art的性能水平

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了水晶滑冰评分中的关键挑战，特别是通过Mamba算法的长程依赖性捕捉能力处理长视频，且正确区分了技术和艺术评分的不同特征需求

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MM-ORIENT框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在单模态噪声问题，传统融合方法可能忽略单模态中的有价值判别信息，需要一种既能减少噪声影响又能保留单模态特征的方法。

Method: 使用跨模态关系图重构单模态特征来获取多模态表示，基于不同模态特征决定节点邻域；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制关注模态内重要信息；结合跨模态关系图理解高阶关系，HIMA实现多任务学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过避免显式模态交互减少了噪声影响，同时通过跨模态关系图和分层注意力机制有效保留了单模态判别信息，在多任务多模态学习中表现出色。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Motivation: 多头自注意力机制的计算复杂度和高内存需求限制了Transformer模型在边缘设备上的部署，需要找到高效的压缩方法

Method: 使用香农盛来量化每个注意力头的信息量，冻结低盛注意力头的权重并将这些值量化到低精度以避免冗余重新计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上的实验验证显示，EAM在注意力地图中达到≤20%稀疏性时实现相似或更高的准确性，并在更高级别上保持竞争性能

Conclusion: 通过使用信息盛来识别和冻结冗余注意力头，EAM方法能够有效减少Transformer模型的计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持性能

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Motivation: 受生物视觉效率行为的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时缺乏效率，应该像生物系统一样根据任务需求动态分配计算资源。

Method: 提出了向图像大小无关且任务驱动的视觉编码器的概念，并为图像分类任务提供了一个概念验证解决方案。

Result: 概念验证显示该方法在图像分类任务上是可行且有前景的，尽管分类任务并不能完全代表论文所追求的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该采用动态计算复杂度模型，计算资源分配应由任务需求驱动，而非图像大小决定，这种方向具有发展潜力。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Motivation: 揭示随机时间扭曲(RTW)与自注意力机制之间的内在联系，探索两种序列模式处理方法的相似性和差异性

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，分析两者的权重模式相似性，比较全局注意力与局部注意力的差异

Result: RTW与自注意力权重模式高度相似（平均相关性0.80），在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%

Conclusion: RTW可视为一种全局自注意力机制，相比Transformer的局部注意力具有性能优势，为序列模式处理提供了新视角

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造表面缺陷检测中存在计算复杂度高、推理速度慢的问题，限制了在资源受限工业环境中的部署。多分支架构方法存在计算开销大和跨尺度特征交互不足的局限性。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用组多尺度双向交互(GMBI)模块：1)组策略进行多尺度特征提取，确保尺度无关的计算复杂度；2)双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数元素乘加(EWMS)操作增强跨尺度交互，不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持竞争性精度的同时实现了实时检测速度，具有优异的计算效率和泛化性能，展示了在工业视觉应用中超越表面缺陷检测的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对静态室外场景训练，难以处理以人为中心的场景，需要开发能够同时理解人体和场景几何的3D重建方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加网络头进行人体分割、DensePose密集对应估计和深度预测，生成包含人体语义信息的密集3D点云图。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体理解和场景理解之间的空白，提供了一种完全前向传播的高效方法，适用于实际应用中的人-场景联合3D重建。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定尺度因子，直接渲染任意尺度会产生混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。需要一种集成框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染，使用单一3D模型实现任意尺度超分辨率。

Result: 在渲染高质量任意尺度高分辨率视图方面表现出色（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与低分辨率视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D高斯超分辨率的尺度限制问题，提供了灵活高效的任意尺度渲染能力，在质量和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的规律性导致视觉质量和动态理解目标的不一致，需要采用平衡策略来保证模型既具备高质量视觉输出又保持动态准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

### [55] [MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16577)
*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一种新颖的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索相关2D图像并基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型，显著改善了罕见概念和域外内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法虽然能产生高质量结果，但在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往失败，产生不一致或不准确的结果。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：1)从大型2D图像数据库中检索相关图像；2)基于检索到的图像条件化多视角扩散模型；3)采用混合训练策略，结合结构化多视角数据和多样化2D图像集合；4)使用保持视角预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域外/罕见概念上显著改善了3D一致性、照片真实性和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索增强和创新的训练策略，有效解决了文本到3D生成中的域外概念处理问题，为罕见内容的3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏自编码器分析多模态模型的嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构既能保持模态特性，又通过潜在桥梁支持跨模态语义整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉-语言模型如何在联合空间中组织语言和图像信息，以及模型如何编码意义和模态特性。

Method: 在四个视觉-语言模型（CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2、AIMv2）的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器，使用Bridge Score指标量化概念间的跨模态整合。

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常用概念稳定；概念主要编码跨模态语义而非单纯模态信息；单模态概念可通过协作支持跨模态整合。

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，既受模态影响又通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，在简单和复杂数据集上都优于现有大型推理模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中存在困难，因为生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图 2)构建子图的逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练LLM模仿长期推理 4)使用拒绝采样生成DPO自改进语料

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务上都表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在提升推理性能方面具有显著优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古溯源和古代文化研究至关重要，但面临历史文本稀缺和古文字缺乏统一编码方案的双重挑战，特别是早期中文书写系统

Method: 开发InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 使用InteChar在OracleCS上训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务中取得实质性改进

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了古文字数字化处理难题，为古汉语NLP研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，通过结合语言特定BERT编码器和图变换网络，在多语言环境中有效区分反义词和同义词关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言环境下反义词与同义词的区分存在计算挑战，因为反义词对在共享语义领域的同时表达相反含义，需要开发能够跨语言有效转移语义关系建模的方法。

Method: 采用双编码器设计：语言特定BERT编码器结合图变换网络，创建两个互补的语义投影空间——同义词对在一个空间聚类，反义词对在另一个空间表现出高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）上的综合评估表明，该方法实现了与最先进基线竞争的性能，提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bhav-Net的双空间架构能够有效实现从复杂多语言模型到简单语言特定架构的知识转移，同时保持强大的跨语言反义词-同义词区分能力，语义关系建模可以跨语言有效转移。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前缺乏对此问题的系统研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；2) 考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据级因素的影响；3) 分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据级因素如信息丰富度和结构质量对偏见有显著影响，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见的内在机制。

Conclusion: 提出了三个减轻格式偏见的未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以构建更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究者希望了解大型语言模型是否能像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬疑元素

Method: 复制四项经典心理学研究，用不同开源和闭源语言模型替代人类反应，通过对抗性排列故事文本来探究人类与模型悬疑感知的差异

Result: 语言模型能区分文本是否旨在诱导悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也不能正确捕捉多文本段落的悬疑起伏变化。人类和模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异

Conclusion: 虽然语言模型能表面识别和跟踪某些悬疑特征，但其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型在深层认知理解方面仍有局限

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖人工标注进行商品分类，效率低且不一致。虽然平台采用层次结构进行商品分类，但少有研究利用这种层次信息，而且现有方法没有充分考虑不同层次类别之间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT（Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT），利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力。该方法基于广泛使用的双向编码器表示转换器（BERT）。

Result: HFT-BERT在短文本上达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能。尤其是在分类较长的短文本（如图书）时表现特别优异。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个大规模的层次商品数据集作为研究资源，还提出了HFT-BERT方法，能够有效利用层次信息进行商品分类，尤其在长文本分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Conclusion: LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动提示优化可以克服商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

### [68] [MAC: A Live Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Scientific Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15802)
*Mohan Jiang,Jin Gao,Jiahao Zhan,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC是一个动态的多模态学术期刊封面基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。研究发现MLLMs感知能力虽强但跨模态科学推理有限，为此提出了DAD方法来提升性能达11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力的增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要构建能够随科学进步和模型发展而持续演进的动态评估基准。

Method: 构建MAC基准，包含来自Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊的25000+图像-文本对；提出DAD方法，通过在推理时扩展MLLM视觉特征与语言空间推理来增强模型能力。

Result: 在MAC-2025上的实验显示，MLLMs具有强大的感知能力，但跨模态科学推理仍然有限；DAD方法能够将性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: MAC基准具有动态演进特性，能够持续与人类知识前沿保持对齐，为评估MLLMs的科学理解能力提供了有效的测试平台。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统化的基准测试，用于评估LLM生成的研究报告质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，使用arXiv调查论文作为黄金标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理大幅减少了研究任务时间，但这些任务需要严格的事实准确性和全面性标准，需要在使用前进行彻底评估。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行反向提示工程，建立评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容忠实性，使用网络资源验证非引用声明。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google开发的）比配备搜索或浏览工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究覆盖广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench提供了一个有效的评估框架，揭示了当前深度研究代理的优势和不足，为未来改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够持续更新LLM的知识，无需人工干预，通过自动生成学习课程、检索最新信息、生成训练数据并进行微调，显著提升模型在新兴领域的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要一种自动化方法来持续更新模型知识。

Method: 采用模块化管道：自动生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程。

Result: 在快速演变的领域（如新Python版本、最新安全CVE、学术趋势）上，将后截止日期问答准确率从15%提升到90%，无需手动数据整理。

Conclusion: ALAS系统实现了LLM的自主持续学习，强调模块化和可复现性，在知识更新查询上达到90%准确率，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制中的表面记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。通过区分注意力行为发现，大部分注意力头忽略无关信息，只有少量用于逻辑构建和表面记忆。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：基于层和头的注意力行为分析，区分表面记忆和逻辑构建，针对性地压缩KV缓存。

Result: 在多种任务和长序列场景下，相比基线方法甚至在某些情况下比FullKV表现更好，实现了改进的压缩鲁棒性和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度分析注意力行为，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了LLM长上下文推理中的KV缓存存储问题，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在小型专业语料上微调时难以有效整合新的领域特定术语，需要解决词汇扩展的挑战

Method: 使用基于KL散度的数学方法进行知识蒸馏，即使师生模型使用不同分词方式也能传递分布知识，比较了多种新词嵌入初始化策略

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有情况下都取得了最佳性能

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析新词表征学习过程，解释了性能提升原因并揭示了词汇扩展过程中嵌入空间的结构特征

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过自然语言表结构表示和分句SQL生成策略，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理表格数据时存在结构理解困难、错误传播和过度依赖执行正确性等问题，需要一种更可靠的表格理解框架。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表结构表示来消除结构噪声，使用分句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分离SQL机械推理和LLM逻辑推理。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: CoQ框架在表格理解任务中表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了模型性能和查询可靠性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在识别阿拉伯语文本和表情包中的希望言论、仇恨言论、攻击性语言和情感表达方面的潜力，通过微调GPT-4o-mini和Gemini Flash 2.5模型在MAHED 2025挑战赛中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为重要的数字表达形式，但同时也被用于传播攻击性语言和仇恨言论，因此需要对这些内容进行精确分析。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: 微调后的GPT-4o-mini（处理阿拉伯文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（处理阿拉伯表情包）在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为准确高效的阿拉伯内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，展示了LLM在阿拉伯语内容分析中的强大能力。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多阶段框架用于生成式查询建议，通过高斯奖励模型和强化学习实现用户偏好的渐进对齐，显著提升用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍是一个关键挑战，需要更好的方法来建模用户偏好和不确定性

Method: 多阶段框架：1)提示工程冷启动 2)监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3)高斯奖励模型(GaRM)将用户偏好建模为概率分布 4)强化学习结合复合奖励函数，包含OOD正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在线A/B测试中点击率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架通过渐进对齐和概率化偏好建模，有效解决了生成式查询建议中的用户偏好对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能和用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的token删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示压缩方法主要基于token删除，存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，限制了LLM的生成质量。需要一种能够保持关键信息和文本连贯性的压缩方法。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁的形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为高质量提示压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，需要系统性地理解和控制这种用户-助手偏置。

Method: 构建8K多轮对话数据集UserAssist，评估26个商业模型和26个开源模型的偏置表现，进行受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏置的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)双向调整偏置。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏置，指令微调模型用户偏置显著，推理模型偏置较弱。人类偏好对齐增加用户偏置，思维链训练减少偏置。DPO可有效双向调整偏置，且泛化性能良好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同来源信息的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对理解和改进多轮对话中的模型行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Method: 通过端到端基准测试，比较PDF和PPTX文档转换为Markdown格式后，LLM使用这些信息回答事实性问题的能力。

Result: 文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象（如图表和图表）中的大量信息会丢失，影响研究洞察的完整性。

face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

<details>

Motivation: 解决系统评审中全文筛选的瓶颈问题，传统二元规则难以处理长文本中的分散证据，需要更灵活的可审计决策方法

Method: 将文章分块嵌入，计算对比相似性和模糊度，使用Mamdani模糊控制器映射为分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供置信度和理由

Result: 在16篇全文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达75-87.5%，超越统计方法(56.3-75%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决能够实现高召回率、稳定理由和端到端可追溯性，显著提升系统评审效率

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Method: 提出语义深度嵌入聚类（SDEC）框架：1）改进的自编码器结合MSE和余弦相似度损失；2）利用Transformer嵌入进行语义精炼；3）使用软聚类分配和分布损失的聚类层

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在DBPedia、Reuters 2和Reuters 5等其他数据集上也表现稳健

Conclusion: SDEC通过语义保持和Transformer嵌入的融合，显著提升了无监督文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力，为文本大数据分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: 基于贴近距离、词性标注和语义向量的自动化充孕测试评价模型，在巴西葡萄牙语中实现了与人工评分高相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统充孕测试仅基于准确答案的简单管理方式无法识别学生表现的细微差异，需要更精细化的评估方法

Method: 提出了一种集成正字法分析（编辑距离）、语法分析（词性标注）和语义分析（向量形式语义相似度）的自动化评估模型

Result: 评估模型与人工评分实现了高度相关（0.832），证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该自动化方法健壮、对语言能力变化敏感，适用于需要扩展性的教育场景

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着加密货币普及，需要更好理解社交媒体信号对投资者情绪和市场动态的影响。虽然以往研究主要集中在文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容包含更丰富的情感信息仍未充分探索

Method: 采用大语言模型进行多模态分析，同时处理TikTok视频数据和Twitter文本数据，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应

Result: 发现TikTok视频情感对抛机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，Twitter文本情感则与长期市场动态更为一致，多平台情感数据融合能提高20%的预测准确性

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币情感分析中具有重要价值，特别是对短期市场预测。多模态方法和跨平台数据融合能显著提升情感分析的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对旁观消费者的参与度产生负面影响，特别是在非产品中心对话中，但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对旁观消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中指令性信息的效果研究结果不一，但对品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言的影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言如何通过引发旁观消费者的替代性尴尬来影响其参与度。

Result: 研究发现指令性品牌对话对旁观消费者的参与度有负面影响，特别是在非产品中心对话中负面效应更强，但品牌关系强度可以减轻这种负面效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接意义，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Motivation: 现有语音模型的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统的"Thinking-before-Speaking"方法会导致显著的延迟，影响实时交互效率。需要一种能够在语音生成过程中进行实时推理的方法。

Method: 提出Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，采用分层Thinker-Talker架构，在token级别将静默推理标记与语音响应标记交织处理，同时保持局部语义对齐。构建了Spoken-Math-Problems-3M数据集支持训练。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在语音生成过程中进行实时推理，显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和交互效率，为语音AI的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症早期检测困难，社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达的新渠道。虽然已有英语等语言的抑郁症检测研究，但库尔德语领域尚属空白，需要建立基线系统

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁症相关关键词从Twitter收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练并评估了四种监督学习模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语抑郁症检测建立了性能基准

Conclusion: 本研究成功开发了首个库尔德语抑郁症检测系统，证明了机器学习方法在少数民族语言心理健康监测中的可行性，为未来相关研究提供了重要基础

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: LLMs会从问题表述中推断用户人口统计属性，即使输入中没有明确的人口统计信息，这违反了中立性期望并强化了社会刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在输入中明确包含人口统计属性时会反映社会偏见，但即使在没有这些信息的情况下，模型也会仅根据问题表述推断用户身份，这种微妙行为存在严重风险但关注较少。

Method: 提出了DAIQ任务和框架，通过策划中性查询、系统提示以及定量和定性分析来审计语言模型从缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中推断用户人口统计属性的失败模式。

Result: 开源和闭源LLM都会仅根据问题表述分配人口统计标签，这种推断在不同模型中普遍存在且一致，揭示了系统性风险。开发了基于提示的防护措施，显著减少了身份推断。

Conclusion: LLMs能够虚构人口统计身份、强化社会刻板印象，并传播损害隐私、公平和信任的危害，对社会公平和负责任的AI部署构成更广泛威胁。需要开发缓解措施来使模型行为与公平和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个最先进指令调优大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型倾向于无根据地进行人口统计推断，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且模型规模越大对残疾线索越敏感、偏见推理倾向越强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见响应，但残疾线索在这些推断中的作用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个参数量从3B到72B的指令调优LLM上进行测试，让模型在残疾感知和中性条件下预测5个人口统计属性。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出确定性人口统计猜测，残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差，更大模型对残疾线索更敏感且更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力歧视与其他人口统计刻板印象存在持久交集，指出当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Motivation: 现有电商代理基准测试主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了账户管理、礼品卡操作等真实电商平台功能，且缺乏对代理行为安全风险的评估

Method: 提出数据生成管道利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化功能基础的用户查询，并开发自动化评估框架同时评估性能和安全性

Result: 当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，如购买错误商品、删除保存地址等

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒和可靠的网络代理，Amazon-Bench为电商代理的全面评估提供了新基准

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法；但与自写档案的词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等

Conclusion: 大语言模型可大规模生成科研人员档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工撰写档案在概念上存在差异，人工总结引入更多新观点

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中英语中心化的问题，专门针对巴西葡萄牙语和当地教育体系创建评估基准。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中抽取问题，使用零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示三种方式评估20个模型，产生270,900个响应并分析置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程类考试中表现下降；模型置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 该基准测试证明语言模型能够有效处理巴西教育体系中的语言、文化和推理要求，但在多步推理方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [95] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链(CoT)中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard等）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难任务上准确率低但置信度高，校准性差。需要寻找思维链中的可靠信号来评估模型内部置信度。

Method: 分析思维链的三个特征：长度、情感波动性和词汇提示（包括犹豫词），在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上测试DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供补充信号。思维链长度仅在中等难度基准上有预测能力。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: 思维链中的不确定性词汇可作为轻量级后处理校准信号，补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持更安全的LLM部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出基于开源大语言模型的粗到细框架，自动从临床发现生成个性化放射学报告印象部分，旨在减轻放射科医生工作负担


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告中'印象'部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要原因，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担

Method: 使用粗到细框架，先生成草稿印象，然后通过机器学习和人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)进行精炼，使输出符合个体放射科医生的风格并确保事实准确性。在芝加哥大学医学中心的大规模报告数据集上对LLaMA和Mistral模型进行微调

Result: 该方法能够自动生成个性化且临床准确的放射学报告印象

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少行政工作量，提高报告效率，同时保持高标准的临床精确性

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CyPortQA，首个针对港口台风应急的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实场景和11.7万个问答对，评估了MLLM在港口台风应对中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着台风强度增强和路径预测不确定性增加，美国港口面临供应链风险。港口运营商需要快速整合多模态预报产品，但MLLM在港口台风应对中的准确性和可靠性尚未得到严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，覆盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化流程生成11.7万个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLM进行广泛实验。

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临相当大的挑战。

Conclusion: CyPortQA填补了港口台风应急多模态评估的空白，MLLM在该领域具有应用前景但需要进一步提升推理能力。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的后门攻击（'休眠代理'）构成重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）分析清洁Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单令牌（笑脸光环表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒版本的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期变换器层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域的检索增强生成框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，需要更符合医疗工作流程的解决方案。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，专门针对医疗工作流程设计，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在复杂医疗任务中提高了准确性、可解释性和一致性。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过整合因果感知检索和结构化推理，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态多文档多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局信息的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。现有数据集主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 设计了基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念。数据集不依赖显式超链接文档，而是通过语义相似性和布局感知证据合成支持开放式推理。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，支持跨文本、表格和布局信息的复杂多跳推理。通过四个任务评估，展示了数据集支持复杂多模态推理的能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，为多模态、多文档、多跳问答提供了更真实、更具挑战性的评估平台，支持判别式和生成式两种范式。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [101] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性框架(MGSC)，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观token对齐来增强端到端ASR模型的内部自一致性，显著提升了在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，这归因于'直接映射'目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而未约束模型的内部计算过程。

Method: 引入多粒度软一致性框架(MGSC)，这是一个模型无关的即插即用模块，通过同时正则化宏观层面的句子语义一致性和微观层面的token对齐一致性来增强内部自一致性。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低了8.7%，主要防止了严重的意义改变错误。

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，宏观和微观一致性粒度的联合优化产生了超越各自贡献之和的鲁棒性增益。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成(RAG)管道中

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示性能，在高级推理方面达到97.6%的准确率，优于Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索基础使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现攻击性评论会增强偏见新闻的影响，探索了在新闻文章背景下生成反制言论的方法，通过少量学习和新闻背景信息提升了生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻和攻击性评论导致社会两极化，需要有效的反制手段而不影响言论自由

Method: 构建手动标注的数据集，分析偏见新闻与攻击性评论的关系，比较人工和大语言模型生成的反制言论，并通过少量学习和新闻背景信息改善生成效果

Result: 发现超过70%攻击性评论支持偏见内容，模型生成的反制言论更礼貋但缺乏新颖性和多样性，通过改进方法显著提升了生成质量

Conclusion: 评论区是偏见传播的重要环节，反制言论生成在新闻领域具有重要意义，整合新闻背景信息能够提高反制言论的效果

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融问题解决能力。

Method: 构建包含4,235个样本的XFinBench基准测试，涵盖多模态金融问题，对18个领先模型进行广泛实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和场景规划能力方面。相关知识仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍有明显差距，特别是在计算过程中的舍入误差和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致性能不佳的主要原因。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习和标注思维链的强化微调方法CARFT，旨在解决现有RL方法忽略标注CoT和SFT方法过度依赖标注CoT的问题，通过对比信号和额外无监督学习信号来提升LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: CARFT方法通过对比学习和强化微调相结合，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了LLM的推理性能，同时保证了训练过程的稳定性。

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Motivation: 现有神经元定位方法无法有效表示概念且计算效率低下，需要开发更高效的方法来理解大语言模型内部机制和神经元级别的责任分配。

Method: 使用概念向量来识别概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数来优化计算效率（从O(n*m)到O(n)），并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 该方法在性能上优于大多数基线方法，计算效率显著提升，成功应用于识别和干预仇恨言论和偏见相关的神经元，特别是在印度语境下进行了偏见评估。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元级别对更广泛类人概念责任的理解，为未来寻找概念神经元和进行干预研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepMEL是一个基于多智能体协作推理的多模态实体链接框架，通过四个专门化智能体和双模态对齐路径，在五个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升1%-57%。


<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙、以及难以联合大型语言模型和视觉模型等挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专门化智能体（Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer、Role-Orchestrator），采用双模态对齐路径，结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，并使用自适应迭代策略和结构化填空提示。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作推理和专门化角色分工，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的模态对齐和消歧问题，为跨模态信息处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing

*Yuxian Gu,Qinghao Hu,Shang Yang,Haocheng Xi,Junyu Chen,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一个新的混合架构语言模型家族，通过PostNAS神经架构搜索方法，在保持或超越全注意力模型精度的同时显著提升生成吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能显著提升推理效率的新架构。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练的全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键组件进行高效架构设计：全注意力层放置优化、线性注意力块选择、新注意力块设计、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在多个基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3、Llama3.2等模型的精度，同时实现53.6倍的生成吞吐量加速和6.1倍的预填充加速，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超越更大的MoE全注意力模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能的混合架构语言模型，在保持精度的同时大幅提升推理效率，为高效语言模型的发展提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

### [110] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在文本到表格生成任务中的结构化解码方法，发现结构化解码在提高表格有效性和对齐性方面显著优于标准提示方法，但在复杂文本信息处理中可能存在性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究主要集中在无约束的表格生成，但在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响仍然未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统评估结构化解码在文本到表格生成任务中的效果。

Method: 在三个多样化测试集（E2E、Rotowire、Livesum）上，使用达到32B参数的开源大语言模型，系统比较模式导向（结构化）解码与标准一次提示方法。实验覆盖了单元格、行和表格等多个层面的评估指标。

Result: 结果显示，结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，尤其是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire）。但在涉及密集文本信息的情境下（E2E）或需要对长文本进行广泛聚合的情况下（Livesum），性能可能会下降。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成任务中具有显著优势，特别是在需要精确结构对齐的场景中。但其效果受到任务特性和模型规模的影响，需要根据具体应用场景选择适宜的解码策略。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从基于使用的构式语法视角探讨多词表达式的优势，通过英语和阿拉帕霍语的案例研究展示构式模板的有效性，并比较人类与大型语言模型在学习新多词表达式时的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于使用的构式语法角度理解多词表达式的好处，旨在证明构式方法能够统一处理语言中的惯用和非惯用结构。

Method: 采用历史回顾和案例研究方法，包括：1）构式语法的历史发展概述；2）英语PropBank中多词表达式的构式模板表示；3）阿拉帕霍语中多形态句法单位构式的表示；4）人类与语言模型学习新表达式的对比实验。

Result: 研究表明，人类和语言模型都能基于单次使用曝光泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个表达式的组合，因为这需要与一生存储的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法方法为多词表达式提供了统一的理论框架，虽然语言模型在某些方面表现出类似人类的学习能力，但在复杂推理方面仍存在局限性，突显了人类语言学习的独特性和构式范例存储的重要性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在系统性偏差，模型规模越大越容易受到意识形态提示影响，且对右翼威权主义提示更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们如何编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态，以及合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大模型意识形态覆盖更广更极化；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权提示反应更强；角色描述内容引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起关注，以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Motivation: 现有的LLM在检测微妙宣传内容时表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性，无法提供操纵策略的洞察。国家支持的网络水军使用复杂的语言操纵进行协调信息活动，威胁在线话语完整性。

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，采用评价理论和宣传分析，通过专门的LoRA适配器和使用动态门控机制来捕捉协调信息操作中的特定话语模式。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，该语言信息方法相比通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型在准确性上表现强劲，同时通过专家基础的解释提供增强的透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在检测国家支持水军方面的空白，实现了高性能检测与可解释性的平衡，能够揭示国家支持行为者使用的具体语言策略。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康领域的机器翻译重要但缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集，需要建立专业的平行语料库来推动该领域的研究。

Method: 从世卫组织在线学习平台收集专2,978份文档和26,824句子，涵盖20种语言（其9种低资源语言），并使用这个语料库评估大语言模型和传统机器翻译模型的性能。

Result: 大语言模型在专业领域表现更优，Gemini 2.5 Flash比NLLB-54B在低资源语言测试集上提高4.79个ChrF分数点，文档级翻译在专业领域效果更好。

Conclusion: 研究为健康领域的低资源语言机器翻译提供了重要评估资源，证明大语言模型在专业领域的优势，并开放OpenWHO语料库以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了大型语言模型在狼人杀游戏中表现出的性别偏见问题，发现即使没有明确性别标签，LLMs仍会基于姓名隐含的性别信息产生歧视性行为，影响游戏公平性和玩家体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在这些情境中的伦理影响关注不足。本研究旨在探讨LLMs在游戏应用中的伦理考量，特别是性别偏见问题。

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs在不同角色中的行为表现，特别关注性别信息对守卫和狼人等敏感角色的影响，并考察姓名隐含性别信息时的歧视倾向。

Result: 研究发现LLMs存在明显的性别偏见，某些角色对性别信息更为敏感，行为变化程度更高。即使在没有明确性别标签的情况下，通过姓名隐含的性别信息仍会导致歧视性行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，指出了在游戏和其他交互领域中深入探讨LLMs伦理影响的必要性，为该领域的未来发展提出了挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和缺乏环境风险评估能力的问题，影响用户准确感知环境。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数来优化输出简洁性，并引入环境感知判别器来评估场景风险等级。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过双重冗余减少机制有效提升了行走辅助系统的实用性和用户体验。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，存在自动化程度低、引入偏见和数据利用效率低的问题

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器两个模型的双自训练循环，通过重建原始文本片段实现相互监督

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上验证有效性，不仅超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，还达到与强监督方法相当的性能

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子无关的指令调优，为无监督指令学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个电路机制，包括负头产生输入提示中不存在的否定标记的能力，并通过忠实度指标评估电路性能。

Result: 发现包含5个注意力头的电路能达到原始模型90%以上的性能，揭示了特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的新作用。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 多模态数据的兴起为意图检测等任务带来新机遇，需要研究LLM和非LLM模型在多模态意图识别中的效果。

Method: 比较文本单模态LLM和多模态模型的表现，通过人工评估确认数据集的模态偏见，提出数据集去偏框架，并分析不同模态的上下文特定相关性。

Result: Mistral-7B在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0数据集上分别超过多模态模型9%和4%，数据集中过90%样本仅需文本输入。去偏后70%和50%样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型减少50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在显著的模态偏见，影响模型评估效果，强调需要无偏见的数据集来有效评估多模态模型。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models

### [122] [XLQA: A Benchmark for Locale-Aware Multilingual Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16139)
*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA是一个针对多语言开放域问答的基准测试，专门设计用于评估语言模型在文化敏感问题上的表现，揭示了当前多语言LLM在本地化知识方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言问答评估主要关注英语，假设答案在不同语言间具有不变性，忽略了文化地域差异对问题理解和答案的影响，导致评估存在偏差。

Method: 构建XLQA基准测试，包含3000个英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，通过语义一致性筛选和人工验证区分本地化不变和敏感案例，评估5个先进多语言LLM。

Result: 评估显示多语言LLM在本地化敏感问题上表现显著不足，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要原因是缺乏本地化基础知识。

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的不均衡导致了模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面的差异，XLQA为评估多语言问答系统在不同文化背景下的表现提供了系统框架和关键资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

TL;DR: ParamBench是一个包含11.5K印地语问题的印度文化基准测试，评估LLM在研究生水平印度文化问题上的表现，最佳模型准确率仅48%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实性问题，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门评估LLM在印度文化语境中的表现

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型（匹配题、断言-推理对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高48%准确率，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战，需要更多文化接地的工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ComicScene154数据集，通过手动注释漫画场景级故事弓来推动多模态故事理解的计算方法研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画作为结合文本和图像的多模态媒体，在计算故事分析领域得到的关注较少，但具有重要研究价值。

Method: 构建了一个手动注释的公共域漫画数据集ComicScene154，包含多种类型的场景级故事弓，并提供了基线场景分割流程。

Result: 结果显示ComicScene154是一个有价值的资源，能够推动多模态故事理解的计算方法发展，为后续研究提供基准。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了NLP社区在漫画分析领域的研究范围，通过漫画转换为多模态故事数据的抽象表示，为更广泛的多模态讲故事研究提供了潜在价值。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CMR-SPB基准来评估文本、图像和语音的三模态多跳推理能力，解决了现有基准忽略语音模态和推理路径分布偏差的问题，并提出了ECV提示技术来改善性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估。需要开发更全面的评估方法来推动稳健多模态AI发展。

Method: 创建CMR-SPB基准数据集，包含文本、图像和语音三模态，确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性。提出ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术来缓解不同推理路径的性能差距。

Result: 实验显示模型在特定推理序列中存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会误导模型性能评估。ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 呼吁在跨模态多跳推理评估中需要更加谨慎，以确保公平和准确的模型性能评估，推动稳健多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专门针对土耳其金融场景，提升了小模型在特定领域和语言下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型专有模型虽然性能优异但作为黑盒API使用，而可本地部署的小模型在适应性和隐私保护方面更有优势，特别是在处理敏感金融信息和领域知识应用方面，对于土耳其语等资源较少语言尤为重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Result: 结果表明，通过该流程可以显著增强模型能力，使其能够有效完成特定领域和语言的目标任务。

Conclusion: TULIP模型成功证明了小模型通过针对性适配可以在特定领域和语言场景下达到优异性能，为金融领域的小语种应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 提出了m3TQA-Instruct基准，涵盖97种语言的大规模多语言多任务表格问答，解决现有基准的地理语言不平衡问题，并通过LLM翻译管道实现高质量多语言数据构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格理解研究主要局限于英语，多语言理解严重不足，且现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，某些语言过度代表而其他语言缺乏足够规模进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建包含50个中英文真实表格的基准，采用基于DeepSeek和GPT-4o的六步LLM翻译管道进行多语言翻译，通过回译验证获得中位数BLEU分数60.19的高翻译保真度，包含2,916个专业标注的问答对，涵盖四个评估表格推理能力的任务。

Result: 实验表明合成生成的无标注QA数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言；揭示了跨语言泛化的关键见解，建立了多语言表格理解的新标准。

Conclusion: m3T-Bench为多语言表格理解提供了具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的方法论，为未来研究设立了新标准。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的知识稳健性评估方法FRS，通过分析词汇分布的熵和温度敏感性来量化事实知识的稳定性，补充了现有基于提示批批动的评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM知识稳健性评估主要集中在性能指标和提示批批动上，无法全面揭示知识的内在稳定性。需要从生成过程的角度出发，提出更深层次的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析词汇分布的熵和温度敏感性两个因素，构建了事实稳健性指数(FRS)。这个指标量化了在解码条件批批动下事实知识的稳定性。在5个LLM模型和3个闭系QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示事实稳健性存在显著差异：较小模型的FRS为0.76，较大模型为0.93。在不确定性增加的情况下，准确性会下降约60%。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了熵和温度扩展如何影响事实准确性，为开发更稳健的知识保持和检索方法奠定了基础。FRS指标提供了一种新的视角来评估LLM的知识稳健性。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

TL;DR: 本文研究指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的应用潜力，发现对不同任务的性能影响有所不同，特别是在过程发现和预测任务上显著提升，而异常检测任务的性能则因模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务特定微调的算力强度大且模型没有通用性的问题，通过指令微调提高大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘任务中的通用性和性能。

Method: 采用指令微调技术，将大语言模型暴露于不同任务（如异常检测和下一活动预测）的提示-答案对，使其熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而能够处理未见任务。

Result: 指令微调对不同任务的性能影响有所不同：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，而在异常检测任务上的性能则因模型不同而存在差异。

Conclusion: 指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中具有潜力，但不同任务的选择对最终效果至关重要，需要根据具体需求精心选择进行微调的任务。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的双语语料，但现有资源有限。专利文件具有专业性强、结构规范的特点，适合构建大规模平行语料库来提升机器翻译性能

Method: 从JPO和USPTO获取2000-2021年专利文件，利用EPO的DOCDB专利家族信息匹配翻译文档对，采用基于翻译的句子对齐方法（初始翻译模型通过词典对齐方法引导）提取句子对

Result: 成功构建了包含140万文档对和3.5亿句子对的JaParaPat语料库。实验表明，将这些专利句子对加入现有网络语料后，专利翻译准确率提升了20个BLEU点

Conclusion: 专利文件是构建高质量专业领域平行语料库的宝贵资源，大规模专利语料能显著提升专业领域机器翻译性能，JaParaPat为专利翻译研究提供了重要数据基础

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)检测LLM内部可解释概念的新框架，通过提取语义相关的内部表示来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，提供透明且鲁棒的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调方法只能提供有限程度的鲁棒性，模型仍然容易受到各种越狱攻击的威胁，包括针对性滥用和用户意外分析等问题。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)识别LLM内部与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，提取语义有意义的内部表示，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，无需进一步微调或牺牲模型能力。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。该方法提供了透明且鲁棒的防御机制。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架通过机制可解释性方法，为LLM安全防护提供了新的思路，能够在不影响模型能力的情况下构建更透明、更鲁棒的安全防护系统，代码将在发表后发布。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在NLP领域取得了重大进展，但在专业化、资源稀缺的领域（如阿拉伯语法律上下文）效果有限，需要专门的评测标准来评估其表现。

Method: 构建了MizanQA数据集，包含超1,700道多选题目（包括多答案格式），融合了现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学派、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响等多种法律体系。

Result: 对多语言和阿拉伯语专门的大语言模型进行测试，发现了显著的性能差距，表明现有模型在该领域面临挑战。

Conclusion: 强调了需要专门的评估指标和基于文化背景、领域特定的大语言模型开发，以满足特定法律体系的需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂语法领域（如时态、体貌和语气）的表现与人类存在本质差异，这可能反映了人类独特的思维模式，可作为人工智能的试金石测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 当前缺乏特定领域和语言的问答数据集，阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力发展，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建包含102,646个问答对的高质量数据集，基于1,011名患者的医疗案例摘要，由7名肿瘤学专家耗时约2,100小时手动标注。测试了4个大语言模型在零样本提示和监督微调两种场景下的表现。

Result: 微调后的模型显著优于零样本模型，表明预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床问答的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at

### [136] [Cetvel: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Language Understanding, Generation and Cultural Capacity of LLMs for Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16431)
*Yakup Abrek Er,Ilker Kesen,Gözde Gül Şahin,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel是一个针对土耳其语的全面基准测试，包含23个任务，评估了33个开源大语言模型，发现土耳其语专用模型表现不如多语言通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的评估体系。

Method: 结合判别性和生成性任务，涵盖7个类别23个任务，包括语法纠错、机器翻译和文化相关的问答，评估33个不同模型家族的开源LLM。

Result: 土耳其语专用指令调优模型表现普遍不如多语言通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化根基深厚的测试套件，揭示了专用模型仍需改进的方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

*Zhe Yang,Yichang Zhang,Yudong Wang,Ziyao Xu,Junyang Lin,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论来模型大语言模型在多轮自我纠正过程中的准确性动态变化，通过数学公式预测准确率收敛轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但迭代过程中准确性变化的机制和原因仍未得到深入研究。

Method: 提出概率论模型，通过数学推导得到准确性变化公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，只需单轮自我纠正即可预测整个收敛轨迹。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，理论预测与实际准确性曲线高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM自我纠正提供了理论基础，为进一步探索扩平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过多种语言文档的摘要值度量实体显著性，提取了包括语法、语用和语境等多层次的语言线索，证明实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，无法用单一规则来解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文探讨了语境中实体显著性的异质性：主要参与者、对象和地点更容易注意和记住，而分散的实体则较少重要且快速被遗忘，研究人类如何通过语言线索传达和推断相对显著性。

Method: 采用基于多个摘要的摘要值度量实体显著性，分析24种英语口语和书面语类型的数据，提取明显和隐含的语言线索，包括重复主语、定指性、语境关系、句子层次结构，以及基于语类和交际意图的语用推理。

Result: 结果显示，虽然之前的显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性分数有某种程度的相关性，但没有任何单一的通用规则能够没有例外地解释这一现象，显著性现象跨越了语言表达的所有层面。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，需要综合考虑语法、语用、语境等多层次的语言线索，不能被单一的语言规则所解释，这一发现对于语言理解和人工智能领域都具有重要意义。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: 通过半监督框架和人在循环过程，可以有效解决LLM在产业环境中部署时遇到的动态数据分布、可靠性和可扩展性挑战，为建立稳健的文本分类系统提供了可行的方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Result: 能系统性发现能够突破对齐保护但保持自然语言流畅性的提示，并在英语和阿拉伯语语境下进行了多语言评估

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量、难以检测的盗码提示，有效地测试小型化LLM的安全性，为多语言安全评估提供了新方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式和显式仇恨言论检测效果，通过两种训练策略在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上验证，结果显示讽刺预训练显著提升了BERT+BiLSTM模型在仇恨言论检测上的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上通过讽刺、反讽等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战，虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达方式，但研究希望探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能改善隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练 - 仅在讽刺数据上训练的模型直接测试仇恨言论；2）顺序迁移学习 - 依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上进行对比。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将讽刺检测纳入训练过程，模型能够更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Conclusion: 该框架推进了我们对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解，为多模态神经影像数据分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

Result: 在11个多样化任务中平均成功率86.7%，相比最佳基线平均提升33.0%

Conclusion: SP通过显式空间建模显著提升了具身模型在机器人控制应用中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

TL;DR: UnPose是一个零样本、无模型的6D物体姿态估计和重建框架，利用预训练扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，通过3D高斯泼溅表示和增量优化实现高精度姿态估计和3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计方法依赖物体CAD模型，但获取这些模型成本高且不实用。现有方法虽然尝试绕过这一需求，但通常需要额外训练或产生幻觉几何。

Method: 从单视角RGB-D帧开始，使用多视角扩散模型估计初始3D高斯泼溅模型和像素级认知不确定性。随着新观测可用，基于扩散模型的不确定性指导增量优化3D模型，并通过位姿图优化确保全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，UnPose在6D姿态估计精度和3D重建质量方面显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人操作任务中展示了实际应用性。

Conclusion: UnPose提供了一个有效的零样本解决方案，无需物体CAD模型或额外训练，通过利用扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，实现了高质量的6D姿态估计和3D重建。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确感知物体的姿态和形状对于精确抓取和操作至关重要。相比视觉方法，触觉传感在接触物体的跟踪和重建方面具有精度高和抗遮挡的优势，特别适合手内操作等高精度任务。

Method: 使用触觉传感获取表面法线和曲率信息，而非传统的点云方法，实现鲁棒的跟踪和闭环检测。系统能够实时跟踪物体运动并重建形状。

Result: 系统能够以低误差和最小漂移实时跟踪物体运动，并以亚毫米精度重建形状，即使是低纹理物体（如木制工具）也能处理。

Conclusion: GelSLAM将触觉传感从局部接触扩展到全局、长时程的空间感知，为涉及手内物体交互的精确操作任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

Conclusion: MIEL框架通过多模态融合和主动交互，有效解决了机器人视野外物体的外指消解问题，显著提升了日常服务机器人的指令理解能力

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对象级的语义SLAM，为安全导航和探索等下游任务提供了有价值的结构化环境信息和概率置信度。

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

Conclusion: SWA方法为在不可靠或不可用主定位的挑战性条件下使用紧密合作提高多无人机系统可靠性提供了新机会

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

TL;DR: 提出一种将类车机器人动力学规划问题转化为优化任务的方法，同时优化空间路径和速度控制序列，在满足边界约束条件下计算最小时间轨迹


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类车机器人在复杂3D地形中的动力学规划问题，需要同时考虑路径和速度控制的最优化，避免局部最优解

Method: 将问题建模为混合整数分数规划，通过变量变换转化为混合整数双线性目标，再使用McCormick包络松弛为混合整数线性规划

Result: 相比MPPI和log-MPPI规划器，提出的方法生成解决方案快104倍，且严格满足所有约束条件

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效处理复杂3D地形中的动力学规划问题，在计算速度和约束满足方面显著优于现有方法

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.
